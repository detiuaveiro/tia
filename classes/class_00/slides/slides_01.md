# Setting Up Your Digital Workspace

**Goal for Today:** Ensure everyone has a consistent and powerful work environment. This helps us learn faster and avoids the classic "but it works on my machine\!" problem.

# What is an Operating System (OS)?

Think of an OS as the **manager** of your computer's resources. üßë‚Äçüíº

  * It's the software that runs everything else.
  * It manages the **CPU** (the brain), **memory** (the workspace), and **storage** (the filing cabinet).
  * It provides a **user interface** (UI) for you to interact with the machine.

We'll be focusing on two main families:

  * **ü™ü Windows:** The most common desktop OS.
  * **üêß Linux:** A powerful, open-source OS family, dominant in servers, cloud computing, and scientific research.

# What is a Filesystem?

A filesystem is the **library catalog** for your computer. It's how the OS organizes, stores, and finds your files. üóÇÔ∏è

## **Windows (NTFS)**

  * Uses **drive letters** (e.g., `C:`, `D:`).
  * Path separator is a **backslash (`\`)**.
  * Example: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MyFile.txt`

## **Linux (ext4, Btrfs, etc.)**

  * Has a single, unified **root directory (`/`)**.
  * Everything, including devices, is treated like a file.
  * Path separator is a **forward slash (`/`)**.
  * Example: `/home/yourname/documents/myfile.txt`

> **Key takeaway:** Understanding the path structure is crucial for finding your files and running programs from the command line\!

# Why a Standard Environment? (The "Linux" Choice)

We are standardizing on a **Linux-based command-line environment** because:

  * **Industry Standard:** It's the backbone of the web, cloud computing (AWS, Google Cloud), and scientific computing.
  * **Powerful Tooling:** Offers unparalleled tools for programming, automation, and data manipulation.
  * **Transparency:** Helps you understand what the computer is *actually* doing.

Now, let's explore your options for getting this environment set up\!

# Your Three Paths to Linux üó∫Ô∏è

1.  **Native Linux Installation:**

      * **What:** Linux is the main OS on your computer.
      * **Best for:** Maximum performance and full immersion.

2.  **Virtual Machine (VM):**

      * **What:** A complete Linux computer running inside a window on your current OS.
      * **Best for:** Safe, isolated, and easy to reset.

3.  **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):**

      * **What:** A compatibility layer to run a real Linux environment directly inside Windows.
      * **Best for:** Tight integration between Windows and Linux tools.

# Option 1: Native Linux Installation üêß

This means you install a Linux distribution (like Ubuntu or Fedora) directly on your computer's hardware, either replacing or alongside Windows ("dual-booting").

## **Pros & Cons**

  * **‚úÖ Pro:** **Best Performance.** No overhead; Linux has direct access to all hardware (CPU, GPU).
  * **‚úÖ Pro:** **Full Immersion.** Forces you to learn and adapt to the Linux environment.
  * **‚ùå Con:** **Complex Setup.** Can be tricky, with risks of data loss if not done carefully (backup is essential\!).
  * **‚ùå Con:** **Hardware Compatibility.** Some specific hardware (Wi-Fi cards, webcams) might require extra configuration.

## **Who is this for?**

Students who are adventurous, comfortable with computer hardware, or have a spare machine to experiment with.

## **Setup Steps**

1.  **Choose a distribution:** We recommend **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** for its great support.
2.  **Create a bootable USB drive:** Use tools like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
3.  **Partition your hard drive:** This is the most critical step if you plan to dual-boot. **BACK UP YOUR DATA FIRST\!**
4.  **Boot from the USB drive** and follow the installer instructions.

# Option 2: Virtual Machine (VM) üñ•Ô∏è

A VM uses a **hypervisor** (like VirtualBox or VMWare) to emulate a full computer system inside your existing OS. We provide a pre-configured image to make this easy\!

## **How it Works: Networking**

Your VM needs network access to download software (`apt install`) or use `git`.

  * The hypervisor creates a virtual network adapter for your VM.
  * It usually uses **NAT (Network Address Translation)**, which acts like a router, allowing the VM to share your host computer's internet connection securely.

## **Pros & Cons**

  * **‚úÖ Pro:** **Safe & Isolated.** The VM is a sandbox. If you break it, it doesn't affect your main OS. You can easily delete it or reset it from a snapshot.
  * **‚úÖ Pro:** **Easy Setup.** Just install VirtualBox and import the provided course image.
  * **‚ùå Con:** **Resource Heavy.** Requires significant RAM (8GB+ recommended for your whole system) and CPU power, as you are running two operating systems at once.
  * **‚ùå Con:** **Slower Performance.** Slower than a native install due to the overhead of virtualization.

## **Who is this for?**

Almost everyone\! It's the safest, most recommended, and most consistent option for this course.

## **Setup Steps**

1.  **Install VirtualBox:** Download and install the latest version of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and its "Extension Pack".
2.  **Download the Course VM Image:** Get the `.ova` file from the course website.
3.  **Import the Appliance:** In VirtualBox, go to `File > Import Appliance` and select the `.ova` file you downloaded. Follow the on-screen prompts.
4.  **Start your VM:** Select the imported machine and click "Start". That's it\!

# Option 3: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) ü™ü+üêß

WSL lets you run a genuine Linux kernel and environment directly on Windows, without the overhead of a full VM. It provides powerful integration between the two systems.

## **How it Works: Filesystem & Networking**

  * **Networking:** WSL automatically shares the network connection of your Windows host. It just works\!
  * **Filesystem Integration:** Your Windows drives (like `C:`) are automatically mounted inside Linux under `/mnt/`. For example, your `C:\Users\YourName` folder is accessible at `/mnt/c/Users/YourName`.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** For best performance, always work with your files inside the Linux filesystem (`/home/yourname/`), not on the mounted Windows drives (`/mnt/c/`).

## **Pros & Cons**

  * **‚úÖ Pro:** **Excellent Performance.** Near-native speed for command-line tools.
  * **‚úÖ Pro:** **Great Integration.** Easily call Linux tools from Windows and vice-versa. You can use VS Code on Windows to edit files directly inside WSL.
  * **‚ùå Con:** **"Headless" by Default.** WSL is primarily a command-line tool. Running Linux GUI apps requires extra setup (WSLg).
  * **‚ùå Con:** **Potential for Complexity.** Some advanced networking or hardware access can be more complex than in a VM or native install.

## **Who is this for?**

Windows users who want a fast, integrated command-line environment and are comfortable working primarily in a terminal.

## **Setup Steps**

1.  **Enable WSL:** Open PowerShell **as an Administrator** and run this single command:
    ```powershell
    wsl --install
    ```
    This command will enable the required Windows features, download the latest Linux kernel, and install **Ubuntu** as the default distribution.
2.  **Reboot** your computer when prompted.
3.  **Create a User Account:** After rebooting, a terminal window will open to complete the Ubuntu installation. You will be asked to create a username and password. **Remember this password\!**
4.  **You're Ready\!** You can launch your Linux terminal from the Start Menu (search for "Ubuntu").

# Summary & Next Steps ‚úÖ

You have three great options. Your choice depends on your comfort level and computer.

| Feature | Native Install | Virtual Machine (VM) | WSL |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Performance** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Safety/Isolation** | ‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Ease of Setup** | ‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Recommended For**| Experts/Hobbyists | **Everyone (Default)** | Windows Users |

## **Your Task Now:**

1.  **Choose one** of the three methods.
2.  Follow the setup instructions to get it running.
3.  Open a terminal and be ready for our next session\!

**Having trouble? Don't worry\!** Ask your professors, teaching assistants, or classmates for help. Getting your environment set up is the first important step. Good luck\! üéâ
