# Why Networking Matters

## Why Networking Matters 🌐 {.allowframebreaks}

Networking is the invisible fabric of the modern world.
It's no longer just about computers; it's about *everything*.

* **Communication:** From email and social media to video calls.
* **Services:** Cloud computing, streaming (Netflix, Spotify), and online gaming.
* **Economy:** E-commerce, banking, and global financial systems.
* **IoT (Internet of Things):** Smart homes, wearable tech, and connected cars.

Understanding networking is no longer optional; it's a fundamental skill for any technologist.

# Part 1: The Building Blocks 🧱

## Key Network Equipment {.allowframebreaks}

First, let's meet the hardware that builds a network.

* **Hub:** A "dumb" repeater. Any packet it receives is broadcast to *every* other port. It's slow, inefficient, and creates "collisions." (Rarely used today).
* **Switch:** A "smart" device for a LAN. It learns which device is on which port (using MAC addresses) and sends packets *only* to the intended recipient.
* **Router:** A "gateway" that connects *different* networks. Your home router connects your private LAN to your provider's WAN (the Internet).
* **Access Point (AP):** A "translator" that connects wireless devices (using Wi-Fi) to the wired network (the switch).
* **ONT (Optical Network Terminal):** Your "modem" for a fiber-optic connection. It translates light signals from the fiber cable into electrical signals for your router (Ethernet).

## The Two-Address System: MAC & IP {.allowframebreaks}

Every device on a network has **two** addresses.
Both are crucial.

* **MAC Address (Physical Address):**
  * Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
  * A unique, 48-bit serial number burned into the network card by the manufacturer. It is permanent.
  * **Used for:** Communication *within* the same Local Area Network (LAN).
* **IP Address (Logical Address):**
  * Example: `192.168.1.10`
  * A logical, 32-bit (or 128-bit for IPv6) address assigned to the device by the network (e.g., by your router). It is temporary.
  * **Used for:** Communication *between* different networks (on the WAN/Internet).

**Analogy:** A MAC address is like your **passport number** (permanent, identifies you). An IP address is like your **home address** (logical, changes if you move).

![From MAC to IP](figures/mac2ip.png)

## How LANs *Really* Work: ARP {.allowframebreaks}

Your computer (192.168.1.10) wants to send a packet to your printer (192.168.1.15) on the same LAN.

* The **Router** only understands IP addresses.
* The **Switch** (which connects them) only understands MAC addresses.

How does the computer find the printer's MAC address?

1.  It shouts to the whole LAN: "WHO HAS 192.168.1.15?" This broadcast is the **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**.
2.  The printer (192.168.1.15) replies: "I DO! My MAC is `00:AB:CD:EF:12:34`."
3.  Your computer stores this `IP -> MAC` pair in its **ARP table** and sends the packet.

## The Language: IPv4 & The Subnet Mask {.allowframebreaks}

An IPv4 address alone isn't enough. It's always paired with a **Subnet Mask**.

* **IP Address:** `192.168.1.10`
* **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`

The subnet mask's job is to split the IP into two parts:

1.  **Network Part:** `192.168.1.x` ("What street am I on?")
2.  **Host Part:** `x.x.x.10` ("What is my house number?")

This is how your computer knows if another IP is **local** (on the same network) or **remote** (on a different network).

## Special IPv4 Address Ranges {.allowframebreaks}

Not all IPs are equal.
They are reserved for specific uses.

* **Loopback Address (localhost):**
  * `127.0.0.1`
  * This address always means **"this computer."** It's a virtual interface used for testing applications on your own machine.
* **Private / LAN Addresses:**
  * `10.0.0.0` – `10.255.255.255`
  * `172.16.0.0` – `172.31.255.255`
  * `192.168.0.0` – `192.168.255.255`
  * These are for use *inside* a private network (LAN). They are not routable on the public internet.
* **Public / WAN Addresses:**
  * Any other address (e.g., `8.8.8.8` or `142.250.184.142`).
  * These are globally unique and routable on the Internet.

## Understanding IPv6 Addresses {.allowframebreaks}

IPv4 ran out of addresses.
IPv6 is the successor and has its own special types.

* **IPv6 (Internet Protocol v6):**
  * A **128-bit** address (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`).
  * Provides a virtually limitless supply of addresses.
* **Special IPv6 Addresses:**
  * **Loopback:** `::1` (The equivalent of `127.0.0.1`).
  * **Link-Local:** `fe80::...` (Automatically assigned for *local* LAN communication. Like ARP for IPv6).
  * **Unique Local:** `fd00::...` (The equivalent of private IPv4 ranges).

## IPv4 vs. IPv6

![](figures/ipv4vsipv6.png)

## Addresses Aren't Enough: Ports {.allowframebreaks}

An IP address gets a data packet to the right *computer*.
A **Port** gets it to the right *application* on that computer.

  * **Analogy:** If an IP is the building's street address, the port is the apartment or office number.
  * **Common Ports:**
    * `80`: **HTTP** (Web)
    * `443`: **HTTPS** (Secure Web)
    * `22`: **SSH** (Secure Shell)

A connection is made to an **IP + Port** (e.g., `172.217.14.228:443`).

# Part 2: The Wide World (WAN) 🌍 {.allowframebreaks}

## Leaving the LAN: The Default Gateway {.allowframebreaks}

1.  Your computer (192.168.1.10) wants to send a packet to Google (8.8.8.8).
2.  It looks at its subnet mask (`255.255.255.0`).
3.  It realizes that 8.8.8.8 is **not** on its local network.
4.  It can't send the packet directly. So, it sends it to the **Default Gateway**.

The **Default Gateway** is the IP address of the **Router** on the LAN (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). It's the "door" out of your local network, responsible for forwarding all non-local traffic.

## Connecting Networks: Routing {.allowframebreaks}

Once the packet reaches your router, what's next?

* The **WAN (Wide Area Network)** is a network of networks (the Internet!).
* **Routing** is the process of finding the best path for data packets to travel from their source to their destination, hopping between thousands of different routers across the globe.

## The "Receptionist": NAT {.allowframebreaks}

**NAT (Network Address Translation)** is the clever workaround for the IPv4 address shortage.

  * It allows an entire private network (e.g., all 50 devices in your home with `192.168.1.x` addresses) to "hide" behind **one single public IP address**.
  * Your router acts as a "receptionist," keeping track of all outgoing requests and ensuring the responses get back to the correct private device.

Try using the [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/what-is-my-ip) to identify your public IP.

## The "Phonebook": DNS {.allowframebreaks}

We remember names (`google.com`), but computers only understand numbers (`142.250.184.142`).

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is the "phonebook of the Internet." It is a global, distributed system that translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.

## More DNS Magic: mDNS & DDNS {.allowframebreaks}

* **mDNS (Multicast DNS):**
  * This is "local" DNS. It lets devices on your LAN find each other by name *without* a central DNS server.
  * This is how `my-laptop.local` or your printer automatically "appears."

* **DDNS (Dynamic DNS):**
  * Your home's public IP address can change (it's "dynamic").
  * DDNS is a service that automatically updates a domain name to point to your new IP address whenever it changes.
  * This is useful for hosting a server (e.g., Nextcloud) at home.

## Keeping the Network Running: NTP & SNMP {.allowframebreaks}

* **NTP (Network Time Protocol):**
  * Keeps the clocks on all computers and network devices in sync.
  * This is **critical** for security (encryption certificates), financial transactions, and accurate log files.

* **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):**
  * Used by network administrators to monitor the health, performance, and configuration of routers, switches, and servers.

# Part 3: Application Protocols 🗣️

## What We *Do* on the Network {.allowframebreaks}

Protocols are the "rules of conversation" for specific tasks.

* **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** The fundamental protocol for the World Wide Web. It's how your browser *requests* web pages.
* **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** This is just HTTP layered on top of **SSL/TLS** encryption. It ensures your communication is private and secure. **Always look for the 🔒!**

## Email Protocols {.allowframebreaks}

* **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):**
  * Used for *sending* email.
* **POP3 (Post Office Protocol):**
  * Used for *retrieving* email.
  * It *downloads* mail to your device and (usually) deletes it from the server. This is an older model.
* **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):**
  * Used for *retrieving* email.
  * It *syncs* your mail with the server. This is the modern model. What you do on your phone appears on your laptop.

## System & File Protocols {.allowframebreaks}

* **SSH (Secure Shell):**
  * The single most important tool for system administrators.
  * Provides an encrypted command-line connection to a remote server.
* **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):**
  * An old, *insecure* (plain text) protocol for transferring files. **Avoid it.**
  * Use **SFTP** (which runs over SSH) instead.
* **WebDAV / CalDAV / CardDAV:**
  * Extensions of HTTP that let you manage files (WebDAV), calendars (CalDAV), and contacts (CardDAV) on a web server. Used by services like Nextcloud.

## IoT Protocols: MQTT {.allowframebreaks}

* **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):**
  * A very lightweight and efficient protocol designed for "publish" and "subscribe" messages (a pub/sub model).
  * Perfect for **IoT (Internet of Things)**: sensors, smart bulbs, and small devices that need to send tiny messages reliably with low power.

# Part 4: Managing & Diagnosing 🩺

## Network Configuration {.allowframebreaks}

How does your device get an IP address?

* **Windows:**
  * Managed via the **Control Panel** or the Settings app.
* **Linux (Desktop):**
  * Almost always managed by **NetworkManager**, a user-friendly service with a graphical front-end (your network icon).
* **Linux (Server):**
  * Often managed by **`systemd-networkd`**.
  * Configuration is done via simple text files in `/etc/systemd/network/`.

## Automatic Configuration: DHCP 🤖 {.allowframebreaks}

In the last slide, we asked: "How does your device get an IP address?" For 99% of devices, the answer is **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**.

Manually setting an IP on every phone, laptop, and smart TV (a **static IP**) would be a nightmare. DHCP automates this.

1.  Your device joins a network and shouts a **DHCP Discover** message: "Is there a DHCP server out there? I need an IP!"
2.  A **DHCP Server** (usually your router) replies with a **DHCP Offer**: "Here, you can *use* `192.168.1.50`."
3.  Your device accepts with a **DHCP Request**, and the server confirms with a **DHCP ACK** (Acknowledgement).

## DHCP Leases & IP Ranges {.allowframebreaks}

DHCP doesn't give you an IP forever. It gives you a **lease**.

* **Lease Time:** The IP is "rented" to your device for a specific time (e.g., 24 hours). Before it expires, your device must renew the lease. This ensures that IPs from devices that leave the network are eventually returned to the pool.
* **IP Range (Pool):** The DHCP server is configured to manage a *range* of addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.100` to `192.168.1.200`).
* **Static Attribution:** By only using a range, the server leaves other IPs free (e.g., `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.99`) for **static assignment**. These are manually configured on important devices like servers, printers, and the router itself, so their addresses never change.

## Diagnostic Tool 1: `ping` {.allowframebreaks}

  * **The Question:** "Are you there?"
  * **The Action:** Sends a small packet (ICMP Echo Request) and waits for a reply.
  * **The Answer:** Tells you if a host is reachable and how long the round-trip took (this is **latency**).
  * **Example:** `ping google.com`

## Diagnostic Tool 2: `traceroute` {.allowframebreaks}

  * **The Question:** "What path do my packets take to get to you?"
  * **The Action:** Sends packets with increasing "Time-To-Live" (TTL) values.
  * **The Answer:** Shows you every single router (or "hop") your packet passes through on its way to the destination. Great for finding *where* a connection is failing.
  * **Example:** `traceroute google.com`

## Diagnostic Tool 3: `ip`, `dig`, `nmap` {.allowframebreaks}

* **`ip addr show`**
  * The modern Linux tool to view your *own* IP configuration and network interfaces. (Replaces the old `ifconfig`).
* **`dig google.com`**
  * **The Question:** "What is the IP address for this name?"
  * **The Action:** Performs a DNS lookup.
* **`nmap localhost`**
  * **The Question:** "What doors are open on this machine?"
  * **The Action:** A powerful port scanner.
  * **The Answer:** Reports which ports are open and what services are (likely) running on them.

# Part 5: Security & Advanced Topics 🚀

## Network Monitoring: Wireshark {.allowframebreaks}

* **The Tool:** Wireshark is a "network sniffer" or protocol analyzer.
* **The Action:** It captures *every single packet* traveling on your network interface and lets you inspect its contents.
* **Analogy:** It's like a video camera for your network traffic.
* **Use:** The single most powerful tool for debugging complex network problems.

## Network Security: Firewalls {.allowframebreaks}

A **firewall** is the "security guard" for your network or computer.

* It inspects all incoming and outgoing network traffic.
* It decides whether to **allow** or **block** each packet based on a set of rules (e.g., "Allow traffic on port 443, block everything else").
* This is your first line of defense.

## Firewall Examples {.allowframebreaks}

* **iptables:** The classic, powerful, command-line firewall built into the Linux kernel for decades.
* **nftables:** The modern successor to `iptables` in Linux. It has a simpler syntax and better performance.
* **pfSense:** A free, open-source **firewall operating system**. You install it on a dedicated computer to turn it into an extremely powerful, enterprise-grade router and firewall for your entire network.

## The Power of SSH: VS Code Remote {.allowframebreaks}

SSH is more than just a remote shell.
The "Remote - SSH" extension in VS Code is a game-changer.

* **How it works:** Your editor UI runs locally, but all file editing, terminal commands, and language processing run on the remote server.
* You get the power of a server with the comfort of your local editor.

## The Power of SSH: Tunnels & X11 {.allowframebreaks}

* **SSH Tunnels (Port Forwarding):**
  * Lets you securely "wrap" network traffic inside an SSH connection.
  * **Example:** Access a database running on `localhost:5432` on a remote server as if it were running on *your own* machine's `localhost:5432`.
* **X11 Forwarding:**
  * Lets you run a *graphical* application (like `firefox` or a text editor) on a remote Linux server, but see and interact with the window on your local desktop.

## Syncing Files: `rsync` over SSH {.allowframebreaks}

The best way to transfer and sync files.
`rsync` is fast, efficient, and versatile.

* **Why it's fast:** It only copies the **differences** (deltas) between files, not the whole file.
* It works perfectly over an SSH connection.
* **Command:**

```bash
# Sync a local folder UP to a remote server
$ rsync -avzP ./my-project/ user@host:~/projects/
```
## The Modern Web: Reverse Proxy {.allowframebreaks}

A **Reverse Proxy** (like NGINX or Caddy) is a server that sits *in front* of your actual application servers.

* It receives all incoming traffic from the Internet.
* It then "proxies" (forwards) the request to the correct internal application (e.g., your Python app, your Node.js app).
* **Uses:**
  * **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple app servers.
  * **Security:** Hides your application servers from the Internet.
  * **Hosting:** Host multiple websites on a single IP address.

## The Modern Web: HTTPS & Let's Encrypt {.allowframebreaks}

* **HTTPS** is essential. It provides the encryption (SSL/TLS) that keeps user data private and proves your site's identity.
* **The Problem:** Certificates used to be expensive and difficult to install.
* **The Solution: Let's Encrypt**
  * A free, automated, and open **Certificate Authority (CA)**.
  * It provides free SSL/TLS certificates and tools (like `certbot`) to automatically install and renew them.
  * It has made the entire web more secure.
