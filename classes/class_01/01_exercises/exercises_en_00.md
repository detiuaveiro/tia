# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Finding Your Way Around 🧭

This exercise covers **`pwd`**, **`ls`**, **`cd`**, and basic information commands.

1.  Open your terminal. Verify your starting location (your home directory) by printing the working directory.
    ```bash
    $ pwd
    ```
2.  List the contents of your home directory. Then, list them again showing **all** files in the **long** list format.
    ```bash
    $ ls
    $ ls -la
    ```
3.  Navigate to the system log directory at `/var/log` and list its contents.
    ```bash
    $ cd /var/log
    $ ls
    ```
4.  Get some information: find out your username and the current date.
    ```bash
    $ whoami
    $ date
    ```
5.  Return to your home directory using the quickest shortcut.
    ```bash
    $ cd ~
    ```

-----

## Exercise 2: Exploring Key System Directories 🗺️

Reinforce your knowledge of the filesystem layout by visiting important system directories.

1.  Navigate to the `/etc` directory, which holds system-wide configuration files.
    ```bash
    $ cd /etc
    ```
2.  List its contents. You'll see many configuration files.
    ```bash
    $ ls
    ```
3.  View the contents of the `os-release` file to see information about your Linux distribution.
    ```bash
    $ cat os-release
    ```
4.  Now, navigate to the `/bin` directory to see where many essential command programs are stored. List its contents and see if you recognize any.
    ```bash
    $ cd /bin
    $ ls
    ```

-----

## Exercise 3: Creating and Managing Files 📂

In this exercise, you'll create, copy, move, and delete files and directories.

1.  From your home directory, create a new directory called `TIA`.
    ```bash
    $ cd ~
    $ mkdir TIA
    ```
2.  Navigate inside your new `TIA` directory.
    ```bash
    $ cd TIA
    ```
3.  Create an empty file called `notes.txt`.
    ```bash
    $ touch notes.txt
    ```
4.  Add text to your file and then view its contents.
    ```bash
    $ echo "My first line of text." > notes.txt
    $ cat notes.txt
    ```
5.  Make a copy of your file named `notes_backup.txt`.
    ```bash
    $ cp notes.txt notes_backup.txt
    ```
6.  Rename `notes.txt` to `important_notes.txt`.
    ```bash
    $ mv notes.txt important_notes.txt
    ```
7.  Clean up by deleting the backup file.
    ```bash
    $ rm notes_backup.txt
    ```

-----

## Exercise 4: Understanding Permissions 🔐

This exercise focuses on reading and changing file permissions with **`chmod`**.

1.  Inside your `~/TIA` directory, create a new file called `secret_data.txt`.
    ```bash
    $ touch secret_data.txt
    ```
2.  View the file's default permissions.
    ```bash
    $ ls -l secret_data.txt
    ```
3.  Remove all permissions for everyone.
    ```bash
    $ chmod 000 secret_data.txt
    ```
4.  Try to view the file's contents. You should get a **"Permission denied"** error.
    ```bash
    $ cat secret_data.txt
    ```
5.  Restore read and write permission for **only yourself**.
    ```bash
    $ chmod u+rw secret_data.txt
    ```
6.  Create an empty script file `my_script.sh` and make it executable for yourself. Check the permissions afterward to see the change.
    ```bash
    $ touch my_script.sh
    $ chmod u+x my_script.sh
    $ ls -l my_script.sh
    ```

## Exercise 5: Finding Files and Content with `find` and `grep` 🔎

Learn to locate files by name and search for text within them.

1.  Inside `~/TIA`, create a subdirectory and a new file within it.
    ```bash
    $ mkdir -p ~/TIA/reports
    $ echo "This is a confidential report." > ~/TIA/reports/report-2025.txt
    ```
2.  Use the `find` command to search for any file ending with `.txt` inside your `TIA` directory.
    ```bash
    $ find ~/TIA -name "*.txt"
    ```
3.  Use `grep` to search for the word "confidential" in your new report file. The `-i` flag makes the search case-insensitive.
    ```bash
    $ grep -i "confidential" ~/TIA/reports/report-2025.txt
    ```

-----

## Exercise 6: Managing Processes ⚙️

Learn how to view and stop running programs from the command line.

1.  Start a process that will run in the background. The `sleep` command waits for a specified number of seconds, and the `&` sends it to the background.
    ```bash
    $ sleep 120 &
    ```
2.  Find the Process ID (PID) of the `sleep` command. You can use `pgrep` for this.
    ```bash
    $ pgrep sleep
    ```
3.  Now, terminate the process using the `kill` command and the PID you just found. Replace `PID` with the actual number from the previous step.
    ```bash
    $ kill PID
    ```
4.  Verify that the process is no longer running. The `pgrep sleep` command should now return nothing.
    ```bash
    $ pgrep sleep
    ```

## Exercise 7: Managing Software with APT 📦

Let's install and remove a program using the **APT** package manager.

1.  First, synchronize your system's package list with the software repositories.
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt update
    ```
2.  Search for a useful command-line tool called `htop`.
    ```bash
    $ apt search htop
    ```
3.  Now, install `htop`. You will need to confirm the installation when prompted.
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt install htop
    ```
4.  Run the program you just installed. Press `q` to quit.
    ```bash
    $ htop
    ```
5.  Finally, clean up by removing the package from your system.
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt remove htop
    ```

-----

## Exercise 8: Combining Commands 🔗

Let's explore the power of the **pipe (`|`)** and **redirection (`>>`)**.

1.  The command `ps aux` lists all running processes. Use the pipe (`|`) to send this output to `grep` to find your own "bash" process.
    ```bash
    $ ps aux | grep "bash"
    ```
2.  Create a log file with one entry.
    ```bash
    $ echo "$(date): Starting my work." > ~/TIA/activity.log
    ```
3.  Use the append operator (`>>`) to add a second line to the file without deleting the first one.
    ```bash
    $ echo "$(date): Finished exercise 8." >> ~/TIA/activity.log
    ```
4.  Verify that your log file contains both lines.
    ```bash
    $ cat ~/TIA/activity.log
    ```

## Exercise 9: Customizing Your Environment ✨

Time to edit your **`.bashrc`** file to create a handy shortcut (an alias).

1.  Open your `~/.bashrc` file using the `nano` editor.
    ```bash
    $ nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
2.  Scroll to the very bottom and add the following line to create a shortcut `ll` for the command `ls -alF`.
    ```bash
    alias ll='ls -alF'
    ```
3.  Save the file and exit `nano` (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).
4.  Load the changes into your current session.
    ```bash
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    ```
5.  Test your new alias.
    ```bash
    $ ll
    ```

## Exercise 10: Understanding the `$PATH` Variable 🛣️

Discover how the shell finds the commands you run.

1.  View the current `$PATH` variable. It's a colon-separated list of directories.
    ```bash
    $ echo $PATH
    ```
2.  Create a simple one-line script in your `~/TIA` directory and make it executable.
    ```bash
    $ echo '#!/bin/bash' > ~/TIA/hello
    $ echo 'echo "Hello from my custom script!"' >> ~/TIA/hello
    $ chmod +x ~/TIA/hello
    ```
3.  Try to run the script by name. It will fail because it's not in a directory listed in `$PATH`.
    ```bash
    $ hello
    ```
4.  Now run it using its relative path. This works.
    ```bash
    $ ./hello
    ```
5.  Temporarily add your `~/TIA` directory to the `$PATH`. Now try running the script by name again.
    ```bash
    $ export PATH="$HOME/TIA:$PATH"
    $ hello
    ```
    This change only lasts for your current terminal session.

## Exercise 11: Scripting Challenge 🚀

Let's create a script that automates creating a project structure.

1.  Create and open a new file named `setup_project.sh` in your `~/TIA` directory. Add the following code, then save and close the file.
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/TIA/my_project"

    if [ -d "$PROJECT_DIR" ]; then
      echo "Error: Directory '$PROJECT_DIR' already exists."
      exit 1
    fi

    mkdir "$PROJECT_DIR"
    echo "Directory '$PROJECT_DIR' created."

    for folder in assets source docs
    do
      mkdir "$PROJECT_DIR/$folder"
      echo "-> Created subfolder: $folder"
    done

    echo "Project setup complete!"
    ```
2.  Make the script executable and then run it.
    ```bash
    $ chmod +x ~/TIA/setup_project.sh
    $ ~/TIA/setup_project.sh
    ```
3.  Verify that the directory and its subdirectories were created.
    ```bash
    $ ls -R ~/TIA/my_project
    ```

## Exercise 12: Scheduling a Task with `cron` 🕒

Let's create a simple script and schedule it to run automatically every minute.

1.  **Create the Script:** In your `~/TIA` directory, create a script named `log_time.sh` with the following content.
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    date >> $HOME/TIA/cron_log.txt
    ```
2.  **Make it Executable:**
    ```bash
    $ chmod +x ~/TIA/log_time.sh
    ```
3.  **Open your Crontab:** This will open a text editor.
    ```bash
    $ crontab -e
    ```
4.  **Add the Cron Job:** Go to the bottom of the file and add the following line. You must use the full, absolute path to your script.
    ```cron
    * * * * * /home/student/TIA/log_time.sh
    ```
5.  **Save and Verify:** Save and exit the editor. Wait two minutes, then check your log file. You should see two timestamp entries.
    ```bash
    $ cat ~/TIA/cron_log.txt
    ```
6.  **Clean Up:** It's very important to remove the cron job so it doesn't run forever. This command removes your entire crontab file.
    ```bash
    $ crontab -r
    ```
