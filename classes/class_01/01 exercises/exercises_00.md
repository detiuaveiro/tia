## Exercise 1: Finding Your Way Around 🧭

This exercise is about exploring the filesystem without changing anything. It covers **`pwd`**, **`ls`**, **`cd`**, and basic information commands.

1.  Open your terminal. Your starting location is your **home directory**. Verify this by printing the working directory.
    ```bash
    $ pwd
    ```
2.  List the contents of your home directory. Then, list them again, but this time showing **all** files (including hidden ones) in the **long** list format.
    ```bash
    $ ls
    $ ls -la
    ```
3.  Navigate to the **root** directory (`/`). List its contents. You should see key system folders like `etc`, `home`, and `var`.
    ```bash
    $ cd /
    $ ls
    ```
4.  Now, navigate to the system log directory located at `/var/log`. List its contents.
    ```bash
    $ cd /var/log
    $ ls
    ```
5.  Let's get some information. Without moving, find out **who you are** and what the **current date and time** is.
    ```bash
    $ whoami
    $ date
    ```
6.  Return to your home directory using the quickest shortcut. Verify you are back home.
    ```bash
    $ cd ~
    $ pwd
    ```

## Exercise 2: Creating and Managing Files 📂

In this exercise, you'll create, copy, move, and delete files and directories.

1.  From your home directory, create a new directory for this class called `TIA`.
    ```bash
    $ mkdir TIA
    ```
2.  Navigate inside your new `TIA` directory.
    ```bash
    $ cd TIA
    ```
3.  Create an empty file called `notes.txt`. You can use the **`touch`** command. Verify that the file was created.
    ```bash
    $ touch notes.txt
    $ ls
    ```
4.  Add some text to your file using the **`echo`** command and the `>` **redirection** operator. Then, view its contents with **`cat`**.
    ```bash
    $ echo "My first line of text." > notes.txt
    $ cat notes.txt
    ```
5.  Make a copy of your file and name it `notes_backup.txt`.
    ```bash
    $ cp notes.txt notes_backup.txt
    ```
6.  Rename the original file from `notes.txt` to `important_notes.txt` using the **`mv`** (move) command. List the files to see the change.
    ```bash
    $ mv notes.txt important_notes.txt
    $ ls
    ```
7.  Finally, clean up by deleting the backup file.
    ```bash
    $ rm notes_backup.txt
    ```

## Exercise 3: Understanding Permissions 🔐

This exercise focuses on reading and changing file permissions with **`chmod`**.

1.  Inside your `~/TIA` directory, create a new file called `secret_data.txt`.
    ```bash
    $ touch secret_data.txt
    ```
2.  View the file's permissions using `ls -l`. Note the default permissions for the **user** (you), the **group**, and **others**.
    ```bash
    $ ls -l secret_data.txt
    ```
3.  Remove **all** permissions (read, write, execute) for **everyone**. A quick way is with the numeric code `000`.
    ```bash
    $ chmod 000 secret_data.txt
    ```
4.  Try to view the file's contents with `cat`. You should get a **"Permission denied"** error. This is Linux security in action\!
    ```bash
    $ cat secret_data.txt
    ```
5.  Now, give **only yourself** (the user) permission to **read and write** to the file. Then, try to `cat` it again.
    ```bash
    $ chmod u+rw secret_data.txt
    $ cat secret_data.txt
    ```
6.  Create one more file called `my_script.sh`. Use `ls -l` to see that it is not executable by default. Use `chmod` to give **yourself execute** permission. Check the permissions again to see the change (the `x` will appear).
    ```bash
    $ touch my_script.sh
    $ chmod u+x my_script.sh
    $ ls -l my_script.sh
    ```

## Exercise 4: Combining Commands 🔗

Let's explore the power of the **pipe (`|`)** and **redirection (`>>`)**.

1.  The command `ps aux` lists all running processes on the system. It's a lot of output\! Run it to see.
2.  Now, use the **pipe** to send that output to the `grep` command to find only the lines containing the word "bash". This will show you your own shell process.
    ```bash
    $ ps aux | grep "bash"
    ```
3.  Let's create a small log file. First, use `echo` and `>` to create a file named `activity.log` with one entry.
    ```bash
    $ echo "$(date): Starting my work." > activity.log
    ```
4.  Now, use `echo` and the **append operator (`>>`)** to add a second line to the file without deleting the first one.
    ```bash
    $ echo "$(date): Finished exercise 4." >> activity.log
    ```
5.  Verify that your `activity.log` file contains both lines.
    ```bash
    $ cat activity.log
    ```

## Exercise 5: Customizing Your Environment ✨

Time to edit your **`.bashrc`** file to create a handy shortcut (an alias).

1.  First, navigate to your home directory.
2.  Open your `.bashrc` file using the `nano` editor. Be careful not to delete anything\!
    ```bash
    $ nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
3.  Scroll to the very bottom of the file and add the following line. This creates a shortcut `ll` that will run `ls -alF`.
    ```bash
    alias ll='ls -alF'
    ```
4.  Save the file and exit `nano` (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).
5.  The changes are not active yet. You must either open a new terminal or "source" the file to load the changes into your current session.
    ```bash
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    ```
6.  Test your new alias\! It should give you a detailed list of all files.
    ```bash
    $ ll
    ```

## Exercise 6: Scripting Challenge 🚀

Let's bring it all together by writing a script. Create a file named `setup_project.sh` and add the content for each part. Remember to make it executable with `chmod +x setup_project.sh`\!

### Part A: The Basic Script

Write a script that creates a new directory named `my_project` inside your `~/TIA` folder.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Part A: Creates a project directory.

echo "Setting up project structure..."
mkdir ~/TIA/my_project
echo "Directory 'my_project' created."
```

### Part B: Adding a Check

Improve your script. Use an **`if`** statement to check if the `my_project` directory **already exists**. If it does, print an error message and exit.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Part B: Checks if directory already exists.

PROJECT_DIR="~/TIA/my_project"

echo "Setting up project structure..."

if [ -d "$PROJECT_DIR" ]; then
  echo "Error: Directory '$PROJECT_DIR' already exists."
  exit 1
fi

mkdir "$PROJECT_DIR"
echo "Directory '$PROJECT_DIR' created."
```

### Part C: Adding a Loop

Final step\! Modify the script to use a **`for`** loop to create three subdirectories inside `my_project`: `assets`, `source`, and `docs`.

```bash
#!/bin-bash
# Part C: Creates subdirectories with a loop.

PROJECT_DIR="~/TIA/my_project"

echo "Setting up project structure..."

if [ -d "$PROJECT_DIR" ]; then
  echo "Error: Directory '$PROJECT_DIR' already exists."
  exit 1
fi

mkdir "$PROJECT_DIR"
echo "Directory '$PROJECT_DIR' created."

# Loop to create subdirectories
for folder in assets source docs
do
  mkdir "$PROJECT_DIR/$folder"
  echo "-> Created subfolder: $folder"
done

echo "Project setup complete!"
```
