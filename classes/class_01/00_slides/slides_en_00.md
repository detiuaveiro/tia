## Welcome to the Command Line\! üêß

### More Than Just a Black Box

The **Terminal** is your direct, text-based connection to the operating system.

  * **Why use it?**
      * **Power & Speed:** Execute complex tasks instantly.
      * **Automation:** Script repetitive jobs.
      * **Efficiency:** Uses minimal system resources.
      * **Industry Standard:** Essential for developers and system administrators.

**Analogy:** A GUI is a restaurant menu. The CLI is speaking directly to the chef.

-----

## The Shell & Bash

The **shell** is the program that interprets your commands. The terminal is the window; the shell is the brain inside.

  * There are many shells, each with different features:
      * `sh` (Bourne Shell): The original, classic shell.
      * `zsh` (Z Shell): A popular modern shell with extensive customization.
      * `fish` (Friendly Interactive Shell): Focuses on being user-friendly out of the box.
      * **`bash` (Bourne Again SHell):** The most common shell on Linux. It's the de facto standard we will learn today.

-----

## The Linux Filesystem (Part 1: Core Directories)

The filesystem is a tree starting from the **root (`/`)**.

  * `/`: The **root directory**. Everything begins here.
  * `/home`: Your personal files are here (e.g., `/home/student`).
  * `/bin`: Essential user **binaries** (programs like `ls`).
  * `/etc`: System-wide **configuration** files.
  * `/var`: **Variable** data, like system logs (`/var/log`).
  * `/tmp`: For **temporary** files.

-----

## The Linux Filesystem (Part 2: Software & Admin)

More important locations you'll encounter.

  * `/opt`: **Optional** software. Used by third-party programs you install manually (e.g., Google Chrome).
  * `/usr/local`: A place for software you compile or install for all users that isn't part of the standard OS distribution. You'll often find `/usr/local/bin`.
  * `/root`: The home directory for the **superuser** (root user). Do not confuse this with the `/` root directory\!

-----

## Hidden Files & Directories

In your home directory (`~`), many configuration files are "hidden" by starting with a dot (`.`). They control how your programs and shell behave.

  * **Examples:**
      * `~/.bashrc`: Bash shell configuration script. This is a crucial file.
      * `~/.config`: A common directory for application settings.
      * `~/.themes` or `~/.local/share/themes`: For desktop themes.
      * `~/.gitconfig`: Your Git configuration.

-----

## Basic Navigation: `pwd` and `cd`

Two fundamental commands for moving around.

  * `pwd`: **P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory. Shows your current location.
    ```bash
    $ pwd
    /home/student
    ```
  * `cd`: **C**hange **D**irectory. Moves you to an absolute or relative path.
    ```bash
    $ cd /var/log      # Move to an absolute path
    $ cd Documents     # Move to a subdirectory
    ```

-----

## Special Navigation Shortcuts with `cd`

`cd` has several useful shortcuts for faster navigation.

  * Move up one level:
    ```bash
    $ cd ..
    ```
  * Go directly to your home directory from anywhere:
    ```bash
    $ cd ~
    ```
    (Or just `cd` with no arguments)
  * Go back to the last directory you were in:
    ```bash
    $ cd -
    ```

-----

## Listing Directory Contents: `ls`

The `ls` command **lists** the contents of a directory. It's your eyes in the terminal.

  * Use **flags** to change its behavior. The most common is `-l` for a **l**ong list format.
    ```bash
    $ ls -l
    -rw-r--r-- 1 student student 4096 Sep 19 2025 my_doc.txt
    drwxr-xr-x 2 student student 4096 Sep 17 2025 Scripts
    ```
    This shows permissions, owner, size, and modification date.

-----

## Seeing Everything with `ls -a`

How do we see those hidden configuration files?

  * The `-a` flag tells `ls` to show **a**ll files.
    ```bash
    $ ls -a
    .  ..  .bashrc  .profile  Documents  Downloads
    ```
  * You can combine flags. `ls -la` is a very common command to get a **l**ong list of **a**ll files.

-----

## Creating Directories: `mkdir`

Use the `mkdir` command to **m**a**k**e a new **dir**ectory.

  * **Create a single directory:**
    ```bash
    $ mkdir my_project
    ```
  * **Create a nested structure:** The `-p` (**p**arents) flag creates the entire directory path, even if the parent directories don't exist yet.
    ```bash
    $ mkdir -p Documents/Work/2025/Reports
    ```

-----

## Creating & Editing Files: `touch` & `nano`

Once you have directories, you need files to put in them.

  * **`touch`:** The fastest way to create a new, empty file.
    ```bash
    $ touch my_notes.txt
    ```
  * **`nano`:** A simple, friendly terminal-based text editor.
    ```bash
    $ nano my_notes.txt
    ```
      * Type your text directly into the window.
      * Press `Ctrl+X` to exit.
      * Press `Y` to confirm you want to save, then `Enter`.

-----

## Getting System Information

The terminal is excellent for quickly checking system status.

  * `whoami`: Shows your current username.
  * `date`: Shows the current date and time.
  * `uname -a`: Shows kernel and system info.
  * `top`: Shows running processes in real-time (like Task Manager). Press `q` to quit.

-----

## Users: Standard vs. Superuser

Linux is a multi-user system.

  * **Standard User** (`student`): Your day-to-day account with limited privileges.
  * **Superuser** (`root`): The administrator. Has complete power over the system.

To run one command with root privileges, use `sudo` (**S**uper**u**ser **do**).

```bash
# This needs admin rights, so we use sudo
$ sudo apt update
```

-----

## Managing Users

As an administrator, you can manage user accounts from the command line.

  * `sudo useradd new_user`: Creates a new user.
  * `sudo passwd new_user`: Sets the password for the new user.
  * `sudo userdel new_user`: Deletes a user.

-----

## Understanding File Permissions

The `ls -l` command shows permissions as a 10-character string like `-rwxr-xr--`.

  * **It's read in groups:** Type | Owner | Group | Others
  * `r`: Permission to **read** the file.
  * `w`: Permission to **write** (modify) the file.
  * `x`: Permission to **execute** the file (run as a program).

-----

## Managing Permissions with `chmod`

Use the `chmod` (**ch**ange **mod**e) command to change permissions.

  * You can add (`+`) or remove (`-`) permissions for the **u**ser, **g**roup, or **o**thers.

**Example:** Make a script executable for yourself.

```bash
# Give the user (u) the execute (x) permission
$ chmod u+x my_script.sh
```

-----

## What is a Package Manager? üì¶

A package manager is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, and removing software.

  * It handles **dependencies** automatically, so you don't have to install required libraries manually.
  * It keeps a database of installed software, making it easy to manage.
  * For Debian and Ubuntu-based systems, the primary package manager is **APT** (Advanced Package Tool).

**Analogy:** Think of `apt` as an App Store for your terminal.

-----

## Updating Package Lists (`apt update`)

Before you install or search for anything, you should synchronize your local package list with the central software repositories.

  * This command **does not** upgrade your software. It just downloads the latest list of what's available.
  * This is a privileged operation, so it requires `sudo`.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# Downloads the latest package information
$ sudo apt update
```

-----

## Searching for Packages (`apt search`)

If you're not sure of the exact name of a program, you can search for it.

  * This command searches the names and descriptions of all available packages.
  * You don't need `sudo` to search.

**Example:** Search for a program that shows system processes, like `htop`.

```bash
$ apt search htop
```

-----

## Installing Packages (`apt install`)

Once you know the package name, you can install it.

  * `apt` will automatically download and install the program and any dependencies it needs to run.
  * This requires `sudo`.

**Example:** Install the `htop` utility, an interactive process viewer.

```bash
$ sudo apt install htop
```

After installation, you can run the program by simply typing `htop`.

-----

## Removing Packages (`apt remove` / `apt purge`)

Removing software is just as easy as installing it. You have two main options:

1.  **`apt remove`**: Uninstalls the program but leaves its configuration files behind (useful if you plan to reinstall it later).
2.  **`apt purge`**: Uninstalls the program **and** deletes all of its configuration files.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Remove htop but keep its config files
$ sudo apt remove htop

# Remove htop and all of its config files
$ sudo apt purge htop
```

-----

## Introduction to `cron` & `crontab` üïí

**`cron`** is a system daemon (a background process) that runs scheduled tasks. These scheduled tasks are known as **"cron jobs."**

  * It's the standard tool for automating repetitive tasks on a schedule.
  * You manage your personal list of cron jobs using the **`crontab`** command.

**Common Uses:**

  * Running a backup script every night.
  * Performing system maintenance, like a weekly **ZFS scrub** or a daily **SSD trim**.
  * Cleaning up temporary files.

-----

## Understanding `crontab` Syntax

A cron job consists of two parts: the **schedule** and the **command**. The schedule is defined by five fields, often represented by asterisks (`*`).

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ minute (0 - 59)
‚îÇ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ hour (0 - 23)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ day of month (1 - 31)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ month (1 - 12)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ
* * * * * /path/to/command
```

An asterisk `*` means "every." For example, an asterisk in the "hour" field means "every hour."

-----

## Managing Your `crontab`

You can edit, view, and remove your cron jobs with the `crontab` command and a flag.

  * `crontab -e`: **Edit** your crontab file. The first time you run this, it will ask you to choose a text editor (like `nano`).
  * `crontab -l`: **List** your currently scheduled cron jobs.
  * `crontab -r`: **Remove** your entire crontab file (use with caution\!).

-----

## `crontab` Examples

Here are some practical examples you might add using `crontab -e`.

**Example 1: Run a backup script every day at 3:30 AM.**

```cron
# Minute Hour Day(M) Month Day(W) Command
  30    3     * * * /home/student/scripts/backup.sh
```

**Example 2: Run a system maintenance command every Sunday at 4:00 AM.**
This example is for a system command like a ZFS storage pool scrub.

```cron
# Minute Hour Day(M) Month Day(W) Command
   0    4     * * 0     /usr/sbin/zpool scrub my-storage-pool
```

**Example 3: Check disk space every 15 minutes and log the output.**
The `>>` appends the output to a log file, and `2>&1` ensures that errors are also logged.

```cron
# Minute Hour Day(M) Month Day(W) Command
  */15   * * * * /usr/bin/df -h >> /home/student/logs/disk_space.log 2>&1
```

-----

## Redirection: Saving Output with `>`

Don't want to see output on the screen? Save it to a file with `>`.

**Warning:** This **overwrites** the file if it already exists.

**Example:** Save a list of your home directory contents to a file.

```bash
$ ls -l ~ > my_files.txt
```

-----

## Redirection: Appending Output with `>>`

To **add** output to the end of a file without deleting its contents, use `>>`.

  * This is great for creating log files.

**Example:** Add a timestamped entry to a log file.

```bash
$ echo "System rebooted at $(date)" >> system.log
```

-----

## The Power of the Pipe `|`

The **pipe** is one of the most powerful concepts in the shell. It sends the output of one command to be the input of the next.

**Think of it as plumbing:** Command A -\> `|` -\> Command B

**Example:** Find all `.log` files in a directory.

```bash
# The output of 'ls' is "piped" to 'grep' to be filtered.
$ ls /var/log | grep .log
```

-----

## Your Environment: Variables

The shell uses variables to store information. By convention, they are in `ALL_CAPS`.

  * `$HOME`: Your home directory.
  * `$USER`: Your username.
  * `$PATH`: A list of directories where the shell looks for programs.

**Example:** See the contents of the `$PATH` variable.

```bash
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

-----

## Customizing Your Shell: `.bashrc`

The `~/.bashrc` file is a script that runs every time you open a new terminal. This is the place to personalize your shell.

You can edit it with a text editor:

```bash
$ nano ~/.bashrc
```

**Remember:** Changes won't apply until you open a new terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

-----

## Customization Example: Aliases

An **alias** is a shortcut or nickname for a longer command. They save you a lot of typing\!

  * Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` file:
    ```bash
    alias ll='ls -alF'
    ```
  * Now, when you type `ll` in a new terminal, bash will run `ls -alF` for you.

-----

## Introduction to Bash Scripting

A script is simply a text file containing a sequence of commands.

1.  The first line **must** be `#!/bin/bash`. This is called a "shebang."
2.  Add your commands.
3.  Use `#` for comments to explain your code.
4.  Make the file executable with `chmod +x`.

-----

## Scripting Example 1: Hello World

This script uses a variable and the `echo` command. It's the "Hello, World\!" of scripting.

**File: `hello.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# A simple hello world script

NAME="Student"
echo "Hello, $NAME!"
```

**To run it:**

```bash
$ chmod +x hello.sh
$ ./hello.sh
```

-----

## Scripting Example 2: Using `if`

This script uses an `if` statement to check if a file exists before trying to use it.

**File: `check_file.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Checks for the existence of the system log file.

FILENAME="/var/log/syslog"

if [ -f "$FILENAME" ]; then
  echo "$FILENAME exists."
  # We could now do something with the file, e.g.
  # tail -n 5 "$FILENAME"
else
  echo "Warning: $FILENAME not found."
fi
```

-----

## Scripting Example 3: Looping Over Files

A `for` loop lets you perform an action on a list of items, like files.

**File: `add_prefix.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Adds "backup_" prefix to all .txt files.

for file in *.txt
do
  # Check if it's a file before moving it
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    mv -- "$file" "backup_$file"
    echo "-> backup_$file"
  fi
done

echo "Batch rename complete."
```

-----

## Scripting Example 4: Complex Script

This script combines arguments, `if`, variables, and a program (`tar`) to create a useful tool.

**File: `backup.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backs up specified items into a .tar.gz archive.

# Exit if no arguments are provided.
if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <file1> <dir1> ..."
  exit 1
fi

DEST="$HOME/backups"
TIME=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S)
ARCHIVE="$DEST/$TIME-backup.tar.gz"

mkdir -p "$DEST" # Create backup dir if needed
echo "Creating archive..."

# "$@" holds all command-line arguments.
tar -czf "$ARCHIVE" "$@"

echo "Backup complete: $ARCHIVE"
```

-----

## Theory to Practice

You've now seen the core concepts of the Linux command line:

  * **Navigating** the filesystem.
  * **Managing** files, permissions, and users.
  * **Combining** commands with pipes and redirection.
  * **Automating** tasks with shell scripts.

Now, let's apply this knowledge in the practical part of the class.
