# Exercises

## Practical Lab: Git & GitHub

### From Local Repository to Open-Source Collaboration

**Objective:** This lab will guide you through the complete lifecycle of a Git repository. You will learn to create a local repository, manage versions, work with branches, and finally, collaborate on a remote project using GitHub.

**Prerequisites:**

  * **Git Installed:** You must have Git installed on your machine.
  * **A GitHub Account:** You will need a free GitHub account for the collaboration exercises.
  * **A Text Editor:** Any text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Nano) will work.

### Part 1: Your Local Repository

#### Exercise 1: `git init` (Creating a Repository)

Our first step is to tell Git to start tracking a new project.

1.  Create a new folder for your project and navigate into it.
    ```bash
    $ mkdir my-git-project
    $ cd my-git-project
    ```
2.  Now, initialize it as a Git repository.
    ```bash
    $ git init
    ```
3.  This creates a hidden `.git` folder. You've officially created a repository\!

#### Exercise 2: The Core Loop (`add`, `commit`, `status`, `log`)

Let's create a file, "stage" it, and "commit" it to our history.

1.  Create a file named `index.html` inside your `my-git-project` folder and add the following content:
    ```html
    <h1>Welcome to My Project</h1>
    ```
2.  Check the "status" of your repository.
    ```bash
    $ git status
    ```
    Git will show you `index.html` as an "untracked file."
3.  Tell Git you want to track this file by adding it to the **Staging Area**.
    ```bash
    $ git add index.html
    ```
4.  Check the status again. The file is now "staged" and ready to be committed.
    ```bash
    $ git status
    ```
5.  Now, save this "snapshot" to your history with a **commit**.
    ```bash
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit: Add homepage"
    ```
6.  Finally, look at the history log.
    ```bash
    $ git log
    ```

#### Exercise 3: Fixing a Bad Commit (`--amend`)

Good commit messages are vital. Let's fix a bad one.

1.  Make a small change to `index.html`. For example, add a paragraph:
    ```html
    <h1>Welcome to My Project</h1>
    <p>This is a project for my IEI class.</p>
    ```
2.  Commit this change with a **bad** message. The `-a` flag is a shortcut for `git add` (for tracked files) and `git commit`.
    ```bash
    $ git commit -a -m "fix stuff"
    ```
3.  Check your log: `git log --oneline`. You'll see your "fix stuff" message. Let's fix it.
4.  Run the **amend** command. This will replace your *previous* commit with a new one.
    ```bash
    $ git commit --amend -m "Doc: Update homepage text"
    ```
5.  Check your log again: `git log --oneline`. The "fix stuff" commit is gone, replaced by your better message.

#### Exercise 4: Ignoring Files (`.gitignore`)

We never want to commit secret keys or temporary files.

1.  Create a file named `.env` and add a "secret" to it.
    ```bash
    $ echo "DATABASE_PASSWORD=12345" > .env
    ```
2.  Run `git status`. You'll see Git wants to add `.env`. We don't want this.
3.  Create a file named `.gitignore` (yes, it starts with a dot).
4.  Add the following line inside `.gitignore`:
    ```
    .env
    ```
5.  Run `git status` again. The `.env` file has vanished from the list, but Git now wants to track the `.gitignore` file, which is exactly what we want.
6.  Add and commit the `.gitignore` file.
    ```bash
    $ git add .gitignore
    $ git commit -m "Feat: Add .gitignore to ignore environment files"
    ```

#### Exercise 5: Branching (`branch`, `checkout`)

Let's work on a new feature in isolation without breaking our main code.

1.  Create a new branch for a new "about" page.
    ```bash
    $ git branch feature/about-page
    ```
2.  Switch to your new branch.
    ```bash
    $ git checkout feature/about-page
    ```
    *(**Shortcut:** `git checkout -b <branch-name>` creates and switches in one command.)*
3.  Create an `about.html` file with this content:
    ```html
    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>This is the about page.</p>
    ```
4.  Add and commit this new file *on your feature branch*.
    ```bash
    $ git add about.html
    $ git commit -m "Feat: Add new about page"
    ```
5.  Now, switch back to your main branch and look at your files.
    ```bash
    $ git checkout main
    $ ls
    ```
    The `about.html` file is gone\! This is because it only exists on the feature branch.

#### Exercise 6: Merging (`merge`)

Your "about page" feature is complete. Let's merge it into the `main` branch.

1.  Make sure you are on the branch you want to receive the changes (i.e., `main`).
    ```bash
    $ git checkout main
    ```
2.  Run the merge command to pull in the changes from your feature branch.
    ```bash
    $ git merge feature/about-page
    ```
3.  Check your files with `ls`. The `about.html` file is now present on `main`.
4.  Look at your history to see the merge commit.
    ```bash
    $ git log --oneline --graph
    ```

#### Exercise 7: Resolving Merge Conflicts

What happens when two branches edit the same line?

1.  From your `main` branch, create a new branch.
    ```bash
    $ git checkout -b change-title-A
    ```
2.  On this `change-title-A` branch, edit `index.html` to say:
    ```html
    <h1>Welcome to the IEI Project</h1>
    ```
3.  Commit this change.
    ```bash
    $ git commit -a -m "Update title on branch A"
    ```
4.  Now, go back to `main` and create a *conflicting* change.
    ```bash
    $ git checkout main
    $ git checkout -b change-title-B
    ```
5.  On this `change-title-B` branch, edit the *same line* in `index.html` to say:
    ```html
    <h1>Welcome to the TIA Project</h1>
    ```
6.  Commit this change: `git commit -a -m "Update title on branch B"`
7.  Now, let's try to merge `change-title-B` into `change-title-A`.
    ```bash
    $ git checkout change-title-A
    $ git merge change-title-B
    ```
    **CONFLICT\!** Git will stop and tell you there is a conflict in `index.html`.
8.  **Fix it:** Open `index.html`. You will see the conflict markers (`<<<<<`, `=====`, `>>>>>`). Edit the file to be correct (e.g., delete the markers and choose one title, or write a new one).
9.  **Finalize:** Once fixed, `add` the file and `commit`.
    ```bash
    $ git add index.html
    $ git commit -m "Merge: Resolve title conflict"
    ```

### Part 2: GitHub - Collaboration

#### Exercise 8: `clone`, `remote`, & `origin`

Let's connect our local repository to a remote one on GitHub.

1.  Go to **GitHub.com**. Create a **new, empty, public repository**. Name it `git-practice-repo`.
2.  **Do NOT** initialize it with a README. We want it to be empty.
3.  GitHub will show you a URL. Copy the HTTPS URL.
4.  In your local terminal, go back to your `my-git-project` folder.
5.  Add this new GitHub repository as your "remote" named "origin".
    ```bash
    $ git remote add origin <PASTE_YOUR_GITHUB_URL_HERE>
    ```
6.  Verify that the remote was added.
    ```bash
    $ git remote -v
    ```

#### Exercise 9: `push` (Pushing Your Work)

Your local repository has history, but the remote one is empty. Let's push your work.

1.  First, let's rename our local `master` branch to `main` to match GitHub's standard.
    ```bash
    $ git branch -M main
    ```
2.  Now, **push** your local `main` branch to the remote `origin`. The `-u` flag sets it as the default, so you can just use `git push` in the future.
    ```bash
    $ git push -u origin main
    ```
3.  Refresh your GitHub repository page. All your files (`index.html`, `about.html`, `.gitignore`) and your commit history are now online\!

#### Exercise 10: `tag` & `release` (Marking a Version)

Your project is at a stable point. Let's tag it as version 1.0.

1.  Create a "tag" that points to your latest commit.
    ```bash
    $ git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First stable release"
    ```
2.  Push your new tag to GitHub (tags don't push automatically).
    ```bash
    $ git push origin v1.0.0
    ```
3.  **On GitHub:** Go to your repository's main page. Find "Releases" on the right side. Click "Create a new release" (or "Draft a new release").
4.  Select your `v1.0.0` tag, give it a title like "Version 1.0.0", and write a short description. Click "Publish release". You now have an official release\!

### Part 3: The Full Open-Source Workflow

#### Exercise 11: `fork` (Contributing to a Project)

You will now contribute to a project that you do not own.

1.  Go to this repository on GitHub (the tictactoe repository from last class):
    **[https://github.com/mariolpantunes/tictactoe](https://github.com/mariolpantunes/tictactoe)**
2.  In the top-right corner, click the **"Fork"** button. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
3.  Now, on **your** fork's GitHub page, click the green "\<\> Code" button and copy the HTTPS URL.
4.  In your terminal (outside your old project folder), **clone** *your fork*.
    ```bash
    $ git clone <PASTE_YOUR_FORK_URL_HERE>
    $ cd tictactoe
    ```

#### Exercise 12: The Pull Request (`pull request`)

Let's make a change and propose it to the original project.

1.  Create a new branch for your change.
    ```bash
    $ git checkout -b add-my-name
    ```
2.  Edit the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file and add your name to the list.
3.  Add and commit your change.
    ```bash
    $ git add CONTRIBUTORS.md
    $ git commit -m "Add [Your Name] to contributors list"
    ```
4.  Push this new branch *to your fork* (`origin`).
    ```bash
    $ git push origin add-my-name
    ```
5.  **Go to GitHub:** Go to your fork's repository page. You should see a green banner that says "This branch is 1 commit ahead..." Click the **"Contribute"** button and then **"Open a pull request"**.
6.  Review the changes, add a nice message, and click **"Create pull request"**.
7.  **Congratulations\!** You have just made a pull request, the heart of open-source collaboration.

### Bonus Challenge: `rebase` (Cleaning History)

Let's re-do Exercise 6, but with `rebase` for a cleaner history.

1.  Get back to a state before the merge. A good way is to reset `main`.
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/my-git-project  # Go back to your first project
    $ git checkout main
    $ git reset --hard HEAD~1  # This rewinds 'main' one commit (deletes the merge)
    ```
2.  You still have your `feature/about-page` branch. Let's make another commit on `main` to create a divergence.
    ```bash
    $ echo "" >> index.html
    $ git commit -a -m "Add a comment to homepage"
    ```
3.  Now, `main` has a commit that `feature/about-page` does not.
4.  Switch to your feature branch and use `rebase` to replay your branch's commits *on top of* the new `main`.
    ```bash
    $ git checkout feature/about-page
    $ git rebase main
    ```
5.  Now, switch back to `main` and merge.
    ```bash
    $ git checkout main
    $ git merge feature/about-page
    ```
6.  It will say "Fast-forward". Look at your log (`git log --oneline --graph`). The history is perfectly linear and clean!
