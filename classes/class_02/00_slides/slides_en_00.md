## Welcome to the Windows Command Line\! 💻

### More Than Just a Blue Box

The **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is your direct, text-based connection to the Windows operating system.

  * **Why use it?**
      * **Power & Speed:** Execute complex tasks and access settings not available in the GUI.
      * **Automation:** Script repetitive jobs with Batch or PowerShell scripts.
      * **Efficiency:** Uses minimal system resources compared to graphical tools.
      * **Industry Standard:** Essential for developers, IT professionals, and system administrators on Windows.

-----

## The Interpreters: CMD vs. PowerShell

Windows offers two primary command-line interpreters.

  * **Command Prompt (CMD):**

      * The legacy interpreter for Windows, originating from MS-DOS.
      * Simple, reliable for basic file operations.
      * Its scripting language (Batch) is basic and less powerful.

  * **PowerShell:**

      * The modern, powerful, and recommended interpreter.
      * Treats everything as an **object**, not just text, allowing for advanced data manipulation.
      * **We will show examples for both, highlighting PowerShell's advantages.**

-----

## The Windows Filesystem

The filesystem starts with drive letters (e.g., `C:`), not a single root (`/`).

  * `C:\`: The root of the primary drive, where Windows is typically installed.
  * `C:\Users`: Your personal files are here (e.g., `C:\Users\Student`). This is the equivalent of `/home`.
  * `C:\Windows\System32`: Contains essential system programs. This is the closest equivalent to Linux's `/bin`.
  * `C:\Program Files`: Default installation location for 64-bit applications.
  * **The Registry:** Unlike Linux's text-based configuration in `/etc`, much of Windows' core configuration is stored in a hierarchical database called the Registry.

-----

## Hidden Files & Attributes

In Windows, "hidden" is a file attribute, not just a naming convention. By default, hidden files are not shown.

### Command Prompt (`dir`)

```bash
# View only hidden files
$ dir /a:h

# View ALL files (including hidden)
$ dir /a
```

### PowerShell (`ls` or `Get-ChildItem`)

```bash
# View all files, including hidden and system
$ ls -Force
```

The `-Force` switch tells PowerShell to show items that would normally be hidden.

-----

## Basic Navigation: Changing Directories (`cd`)

Moving around the filesystem is fundamental. The `cd` command works in both, but with a key difference.

| Interpreter | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CMD** | `cd C:\Users\Student` | Changes the directory. |
| | `D:` | To change drives, type the drive letter. |
| **PowerShell** | `cd C:\Users\Student` | Changes the directory. |
| | `cd D:` | Changes the drive directly. |

**Key takeaway:** PowerShell's `cd` is more intuitive as it handles path and drive changes with one command.

-----

## Basic Navigation: Finding Your Way

| Task | Command Prompt (CMD) | PowerShell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Print current location** | `cd` (with no arguments) | `Get-Location` (alias: `pwd`) |
| **Go up one level** | `cd ..` | `cd ..` |
| **Go to user's home** | `cd %USERPROFILE%` | `cd ~` |

-----

## Listing Directory Contents (`dir`, `ls`)

`dir` and `Get-ChildItem` (aliased as `ls`) are your eyes in the terminal.

### Command Prompt (`dir`)

```bash
# Simple listing
$ dir

# Wide format, less detail
$ dir /w
```

### PowerShell (`Get-ChildItem` or `ls`)

```bash
# Simple listing (like Linux ls)
$ ls

# A more detailed view (like Linux ls -l)
$ ls | Format-List
```

-----

## Creating Directories (`mkdir`)

Both shells use `mkdir` (or `md`), but PowerShell's is more powerful.

### Command Prompt

In CMD, you must create each level of a nested directory path one by one.

```bash
$ mkdir Projects
$ mkdir Projects\TIA
```

### PowerShell

PowerShell can create the entire parent path automatically, similar to `mkdir -p` in Linux.

```bash
# This single command creates both 'Projects' and 'TIA'
$ mkdir Projects\TIA
```

-----

## Creating Files

Windows has no direct `touch` equivalent, so we use other methods.

### Command Prompt

Uses redirection. `echo.` creates a blank line, which is redirected to a new file.

```bash
# Creates an empty file
$ echo. > notes.txt

# Creates a file with content (overwrites)
$ echo My first line. > notes.txt

# Appends content to a file
$ echo My second line. >> notes.txt
```

-----

### PowerShell

Uses the `New-Item` cmdlet for empty files and `Set-Content` for content.

```bash
# Creates an empty file
$ New-Item notes.txt

# Creates a file with content (overwrites)
$ Set-Content -Path notes.txt -Value "My first line."

# Appends content to a file
$ Add-Content -Path notes.txt -Value "My second line."
```

-----

## Editing Files with Notepad

Windows does not have a built-in modern terminal editor like `nano` or `vim`.

Your primary tool for editing files from the CLI is to launch a graphical editor like **Notepad**.

```bash
# This works in both CMD and PowerShell
$ notepad my_file.txt
```

This command will open `my_file.txt` in the Notepad application. If the file doesn't exist, Notepad will ask if you want to create it.

-----

## Getting System Information (Part 1)

| Task | Command Prompt (CMD) | PowerShell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current user** | `whoami` or `echo %USERNAME%` | `whoami` or `$env:USERNAME` |
| **Date/Time** | `date /t && time /t` | `Get-Date` |

-----

## Getting System Information (Part 2)

| Task | Command Prompt (CMD) | PowerShell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General System Info** | `systeminfo` | `Get-ComputerInfo` |
| **Running Processes** | `tasklist` | `Get-Process` (alias: `ps`) |

-----

## Users & Privileges (Administrator)

Windows has two main user levels: **Standard User** and **Administrator**.

  * **Administrator** is the equivalent of Linux's `root` user.
  * There is no direct equivalent of `sudo`. To run a single command with elevated privileges, you must open a **new, elevated terminal**.

**How to Elevate:**

1.  Search for "cmd" or "powershell" in the Start Menu.
2.  Right-click the icon and select **"Run as administrator."**

Any command run in this new window will have full administrative rights.

-----

## Package Management: Winget

Modern Windows includes the **Windows Package Manager (`winget`)**, a command-line tool for installing software. It works in both CMD and PowerShell.

```bash
# Search for an application (e.g., 7zip)
$ winget search 7zip

# Install an application
$ winget install 7zip.7zip

# List installed applications
$ winget list

# Uninstall an application
$ winget uninstall 7zip.7zip
```

**Alternative:** For years, the community standard has been **Chocolatey**, which remains a very powerful alternative.

-----

## Automation with Task Scheduler

The equivalent of `cron` in Windows is the **Task Scheduler**.

### Command Prompt (`schtasks`)

Create a task to run a script every day at 8 AM.

```bash
$ schtasks /create /sc daily /tn "My Task" /tr "C:\Scripts\my_script.bat" /st 08:00
```

### PowerShell (`*-ScheduledTask`)

PowerShell provides a more structured way to create tasks.

```powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "C:\Scripts\MyScript.ps1"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 8am
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -TaskName "My Task"
```

-----

## The Power of the Pipe `|`

The pipe sends output from one command to another. In PowerShell, this is more powerful because it sends **structured objects**, not just text.

### Command Prompt (Text Pipe)

Find the "explorer" process from the full text list.

```bash
$ tasklist | findstr /i "explorer"
```

### PowerShell (Object Pipe)

Get process objects, filter them, and select specific properties.

```powershell
# Get the process object for "explorer"
$ Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq "explorer" }

# Get the process and select only its name and CPU usage
$ Get-Process "explorer" | Select-Object Name, CPU
```

-----

## Environment Variables

Variables that store system settings. The syntax is different in each shell.

### Command Prompt

```bash
# View a variable using %VAR%
$ echo %PATH%

# Set a variable for the current session
$ set MYVAR=Hello
```

### PowerShell

```bash
# View a variable using $env:VAR
$ echo $env:Path

# Set a variable for the current session
$ $env:MYVAR="Hello"
```

**Note:** To make a variable change **permanent**, you must use the `setx` command or edit System Properties in the GUI.

-----

## Introduction to Scripting

  * **Batch Scripts (`.bat`, `.cmd`):** The traditional scripting language for CMD. Simple but clunky.
  * **PowerShell Scripts (`.ps1`):** A modern, full-featured scripting language. Powerful and versatile.

### How to Execute Scripts

1.  Save your code in a text file with the correct extension (`.bat` or `.ps1`).
2.  Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the script:
      * **CMD:** `my_script.bat`
      * **PowerShell:** `./my_script.ps1`

**PowerShell Security:** By default, running PowerShell scripts is disabled. You may need to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` in an elevated PowerShell to enable it.

-----

## Scripting Example 1: Hello User

### Batch (`hello.bat`)

```batch
@echo off
REM Sets a variable and prints it
set USERNAME=Student
echo Hello, %USERNAME%!
```

### PowerShell (`hello.ps1`)

```powershell
# Sets a variable and prints it
$Username = "Student"
Write-Host "Hello, $Username!"
```

-----

## Scripting Example 2: If File Exists

### Batch (`check_file.bat`)

```batch
@echo off
REM Checks if a file exists in the current directory
if exist "notes.txt" (
    echo "notes.txt was found."
) else (
    echo "notes.txt was NOT found."
)
```

### PowerShell (`check_file.ps1`)

```powershell
# Checks if a file exists in the current directory
if (Test-Path "./notes.txt") {
    Write-Host "notes.txt was found."
} else {
    Write-Host "notes.txt was NOT found."
}
```

-----

## Scripting Example 3: Looping Through Files

### Batch (`list_files.bat`)

```batch
@echo off
REM Lists all .txt files in the current directory
echo Found the following text files:
for %%F in (*.txt) do (
    echo - %%F
)
```

### PowerShell (`list_files.ps1`)

```powershell
# Lists all .txt files in the current directory
Write-Host "Found the following text files:"
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem "*.txt") {
    Write-Host "- $($file.Name)"
}
```

-----

## Final Thoughts: CMD vs. PowerShell

  * **Use CMD when:** You need to run very simple, old commands or legacy batch files.
  * **Use PowerShell when:** You want to perform administrative tasks, automate complex workflows, or manage Windows systems efficiently. It is the future of the Windows command line.

For any serious work, **learning PowerShell is highly recommended**. It is more powerful, consistent, and provides far better control over the Windows operating system.
