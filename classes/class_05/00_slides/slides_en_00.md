## Application Containers & Sandboxing on Linux

### A Deep Dive into AppImage, Snap, and Flatpak

-----

## The Core Problem: "Linux Dependency Hell" 👹

Traditional Linux apps rely on **shared system libraries** (`.so` files).

  * **The Conflict:**
      * App A needs `libXYZ v1.0`
      * App B needs `libXYZ v2.0`
  * **The Result:**
      * Your package manager (`apt`, `dnf`) can often only install one version.
      * Installing App B breaks App A (or vice-versa).

-----

## The Need for Isolation & Portability

  * **Portability:** An app packaged with its dependencies will "run anywhere" on any Linux distro, regardless of its system libraries.
  * **Stability:** Apps can't conflict with each other's dependencies.
  * **Security:** If an app is isolated (sandboxed), it can't read your SSH keys, browser history, or other sensitive data.

-----

## How Other OSes Handle This

This isn't just a Linux problem.

  * **Windows:** Apps bundle almost *all* their `.dll` files in their installation folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\App`).

      * **Pro:** Prevents conflicts.
      * **Con:** Lots of duplication; inefficient.

  * **macOS:** `.app` "bundles" are just folders that contain the app's binary and all its libraries.

      * **Pro:** Self-contained and portable.
      * **Con:** Also duplicates libraries.

-----

## "Natural" Isolation: VMs & Runtimes

Some technologies provide isolation by their very nature.

  * **Java Virtual Machine (JVM):**

      * The OS runs the `java` process, not your app directly.
      * The JVM runs the Java bytecode in a managed, sandboxed environment.

-----

  * **Python Virtual Environments (`venv`):**

      * This is **dependency isolation**, not security sandboxing.
      * Creates a local folder (`.venv`) with its own Python interpreter and packages (like `pygame`).
      * A `requirements.txt` file lists all dependencies, allowing `pip install -r requirements.txt` to create a reproducible environment, just as we did in our exercise.
      * This solves the "App A vs. App B" problem on our local machine but doesn't stop the app from reading our files.

-----

## The Modern Linux Solutions

Three major technologies emerged to solve this for *any* application, aiming to bundle the app *and* its dependencies.

1.  **AppImage 📦**

      * **Philosophy:** "One app = one file." No installation needed.

2.  **Snap 🧩**

      * **Philosophy:** "A secure, universal package." Backed by Canonical (Ubuntu).

3.  **Flatpak 🎁**

      * **Philosophy:** "The future of desktop apps." Backed by Red Hat & the GNOME community.

-----

## Deep Dive: AppImage 📦

  * **Isolation:** **None by default.** It's about portability, not security. The app runs as a normal user process.

      * *(Can be sandboxed by optional, external tools like `firejail`)*.

  * **Dependencies:** **"Bundle Everything."** The app bundles all libraries it needs, assuming only a minimal base system.

  * **Host Access:** **Full User Access.** The app can see and modify anything the user who ran it can.

-----

## Deep Dive: Snap 🧩

  * **Isolation:** **Strong Sandbox.** Uses Linux kernel features like **cgroups**, **namespaces**, and **AppArmor** to strictly confine the app.

  * **Dependencies:** **Bundled + Core Snaps.** Apps bundle their specific libraries but also depend on a shared `core` snap (e.g., `core22`) that provides a base Ubuntu runtime.

  * **Host Access:** **"Interfaces."** Denied by default. The app must declare what it needs (e.g., `network`, `home`, `camera`).

-----

## Deep Dive: Flatpak 🎁

  * **Isolation:** **Strong Sandbox.** Uses kernel **namespaces** and a tool called **Bubblewrap (`bwrap`)** to create a private environment for the app.

  * **Dependencies:** **Shared Runtimes.** An app requests a "Runtime" (e.g., `org.gnome.Platform`). This is downloaded *once* and shared by all apps that need it. Very efficient.

  * **Host Access:** **"Portals."** Denied by default. When an app needs a file, it asks a Portal, which opens a file-picker *outside* the sandbox. The user picks a file, and *only* that file is given to the app.

-----

## Comparison: Sandboxing & Dependencies

| Feature | AppImage | Snap | Flatpak |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sandboxing** | ❌ None (by default) | ✅ Strong (AppArmor) | ✅ Strong (Bubblewrap) |
| **Permissions** | Full user access | Interfaces (Declarative) | Portals (Interactive) |
| **Dependency Model**| All bundled in file | Bundled + Core snaps | Shared Runtimes |

-----

## Comparison: Distribution & Backing

| Feature | AppImage | Snap | Flatpak |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Distribution** | Decentralized (any URL) | Centralized (Snap Store) | Decentralized (Repos) |
| **Central Backer** | Community | Canonical (Ubuntu) | Red Hat / GNOME |
| **Needs a Daemon?**| ❌ No | ✅ Yes (`snapd`) | ✅ Yes (`flatpak-daemon`) |
| **Desktop Integration**| Optional (`appimaged`) | Automatic | Automatic |

-----

## Limitations: The Trade-Offs

  * **Disk Space:**

      * **AppImage/Snap:** Bundling can be inefficient. A 10MB app might become a 150MB package.
      * **Flatpak:** Runtimes are large (often 500MB+), but this is a **one-time** download.

  * **Startup Time:**

      * **AppImage:** Must mount the compressed file system on every launch (can be slow).
      * **Snap:** Notoriously slow *first launch* as it sets up the sandbox.

-----

## Limitations: The "Jail" Problem

  * **Security vs. Usability:**

      * The sandbox is a "jail." This is great for security but can be frustrating.
      * "Why can't my app see my home folder?" This is a **feature**, not a bug, but it requires apps to be written to use Portals correctly.

  * **Not for Everything:**

      * Poorly suited for command-line tools that need deep system integration (e.g., `docker`, `htop`, system drivers).

-----

## Practical: The AppImage `AppDir` Structure

An AppImage is just a compressed directory. This directory is called the **`AppDir`**.

**`MyGame.AppDir/`** (The root folder)

  * **`AppRun` (Required):** The entrypoint script. This is what runs when you double-click the AppImage. It's our job to write this script to set up the environment (like `PYTHONPATH` for Pygame) and launch the main binary.

  -----

  * **`my-game.desktop` (Required):** The desktop integration file. It tells the system's app menu:
      * `Name=My Game`
      * `Exec=AppRun` (Always `AppRun`)
      * `Icon=my-game` (The name of the icon, without extension)
  * **`my-game.png` (Required):** The icon file named in the `.desktop` file.
  * **`usr/`...:** A standard Linux structure containing your binaries, libraries, and the portable Python interpreter.

-----

## Practical: AppImage "Hello World"

Here, we create the *minimal* `AppDir` structure.

1.  **Create the directory, script, and metadata:**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p HelloWorld.AppDir
    cd HelloWorld.AppDir

    # Create the AppRun entrypoint
    echo '#!/bin/bash' > AppRun
    echo 'echo "Hello from an AppImage!"' >> AppRun
    chmod +x AppRun

    # Create the desktop file
    echo '[Desktop Entry]' > hello.desktop
    echo 'Name=Hello' >> hello.desktop
    echo 'Exec=AppRun' >> hello.desktop
    echo 'Icon=hello' >> hello.desktop
    echo 'Type=Application' >> hello.desktop

    # Add a dummy icon
    touch hello.png
    ```

-----

## Practical: Bundling the AppImage

1.  **Bundle it\!**

    ```bash
    # Go back to parent dir
    cd ..

    # Download appimagetool (only need to do this once)
    wget https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/releases/download/continuous/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage
    chmod +x appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage

    # Run the tool on your directory
    # We must set ARCH for script-based apps
    ARCH=x86_64 ./appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage HelloWorld.AppDir
    ```

    **Result:** You now have `Hello-x86_64.AppImage`. Run it:
    `./Hello-x86_64.AppImage`

-----

## Practical: The Flatpak Manifest (`.yml`)

A Flatpak is built from a "manifest" file that acts as a "recipe."

  * `app-id`: The unique name (e.g., `com.example.HelloWorld`).
  * `runtime` / `sdk`: The base system to build upon (e.g., `org.gnome.Platform`). We don't bundle Python; we use the one from the runtime.
  * `command`: The executable to run.
  * `modules`: The list of "parts" to build. This is where we list our app's code and its dependencies (like `pygame` from PyPI or our game from a `git` URL).

-----

## Practical: Flatpak "Hello World"

1.  **Create the script:**

    ```bash
    # Create a file named hello.sh
    echo '#!/bin/sh' > hello.sh
    echo 'echo "Hello from a Flatpak Sandbox!"' >> hello.sh
    ```

2.  **Create the manifest (`com.example.HelloWorld.yml`):**

    ```yaml
    app-id: com.example.HelloWorld
    runtime: org.freedesktop.Platform
    runtime-version: '25.08'
    sdk: org.freedesktop.Sdk
    command: hello.sh
    modules:
      - name: hello-module
        buildsystem: simple
        build-commands:
          # Install the script into the sandbox
          - install -Dm755 hello.sh /app/bin/hello.sh
        sources:
          - type: file
            path: hello.sh
    ```

-----

## Practical: The `flatpak-builder` Tool

The `flatpak-builder` command reads your `.yml` manifest and performs the build inside a clean, sandboxed environment.

```bash
# 1. Build and install the app
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean \
  build-dir com.example.HelloWorld.yml
```

  * **`--user`**: Installs for the current user (no `sudo`).
  * **`--install`**: Installs the app as soon as it's built.
  * **`--force-clean`**: Deletes the old build directory for a fresh start.
  * **`build-dir`**: A temporary folder for the build process.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# 2. Run your new app!
flatpak run com.example.HelloWorld
```

-----

## Practical: Flatpak Repositories

Flatpak is decentralized, like `git`. There is no single "store."

  * **What is a Repository?**

      * A server (or local folder) that hosts apps, managed by `ostree`.
      * You can have multiple "remotes" (repositories) configured.

  * **Flathub: The "Main" Repo**

      * `flathub.org` is the *de facto* central repository for most desktop apps (Spotify, VS Code, GIMP, Steam).
      * `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`

  -----

  * **How to Publish:**

      * To get your app on Flathub, you submit your `.yml` manifest file to their GitHub repository as a pull request.
      * Their build system automatically builds, signs, and publishes your app for you.

-----

## Conclusion

  * **Isolation** solves "Dependency Hell" and adds **security**.

  * **AppImage:** Best for simple **portability**.

      * *Focus:* Manually creating a file structure (`AppDir`) and an `AppRun` script.

  * **Snap:** Strong in **IoT/Server** and on Ubuntu.

      * *Focus:* Central store, strong security.

  * **Flatpak:** The leader in the **desktop** space.

      * *Focus:* Writing a declarative "recipe" (`.yml` manifest) and letting `flatpak-builder` and shared runtimes do the heavy lifting.
