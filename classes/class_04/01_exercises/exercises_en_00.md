# Exercises

## Practical Lab: Working with Docker Compose

**Objective:** This lab will guide you through the fundamentals of creating, managing, and deploying applications using Docker (with focus on Compose files). You will apply the concepts of images, containers, volumes, and networking to build and run single and multi-service applications.

**Prerequisites:**

  * A computer with a modern web browser and a text editor.
  * Docker and Docker Compose installed.

-----

## Installing Docker on Debian

If you are using a Linux host, follow these steps in your terminal to install the latest version of Docker. Based on these [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/).

1.  **Set up Docker's `apt` repository:**
    ```bash
    # Remove non-official docker packages
    sudo apt remove docker.io docker-doc \
    docker-compose podman-docker containerd runc
    
    # Update package index and install prerequisites
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ca-certificates curl

    # Add Docker’s official GPG key
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg \
    -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

    # Add the repository to Apt sources:
    echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] \
      https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
      $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt update
    ```
2.  **Install the Docker packages:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io \
    docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
    ```
3.  **Manage Docker as a non-root user (Recommended):**
    To run `docker` commands without `sudo`, add your user to the `docker` group.
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
    **Important:** You must log out and log back in for this change to take effect.

## Exercise 1: "Hello, World" with Docker Compose

**Goal:** Understand the basic structure of a `compose.yml` file and run a pre-built image.

1.  Create a new folder for this exercise (e.g., `ex1-helloworld`).
2.  Inside the folder, create a new file named `compose.yml` with the following content:
    ```yaml
    services:
      hello:
        image: hello-world
    ```
3.  Open your terminal in this folder and run the application.
    ```bash
    $ docker compose up
    ```
4.  Observe the output. The `hello-world` container will start, print its message, and then exit.
5.  Clean up the created container.
    ```bash
    $ docker compose down
    ```

-----

## Exercise 2: Building a Custom Web Server Image

**Goal:** Use a `Dockerfile` with Docker Compose to create a self-contained application image.

1.  Create a new folder (`ex2-build`) and a subfolder inside it named `my-website`.
2.  Inside `my-website`, create a file named `index.html`:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>This page was built into the Docker image!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
3.  In the root of the `ex2-build` folder, create a `Dockerfile`:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY ./my-website /usr/share/nginx/html
    ```
4.  Finally, create your `compose.yml` file:
    ```yaml
    services:
      webserver:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "8080:80"
    ```
5.  Build and start the service. The `-d` flag runs it in the background.
    ```bash
    $ docker compose up --build -d
    ```
6.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see your custom webpage.

-----

## Exercise 3: Live Development with Volumes

**Goal:** Understand how volumes allow you to change your website's content without rebuilding the image.

1.  Create a new folder (`ex3-volumes`) with the same `my-website/index.html` structure as the previous exercise.
2.  Create a `compose.yml` file. This time, we will use the standard `nginx:alpine` image and mount our local folder as a volume. **No `Dockerfile` is needed.**
    ```yaml
    services:
      webserver:
        image: nginx:alpine
        ports:
          - "8080:80"
        volumes:
          - ./my-website:/usr/share/nginx/html
    ```
3.  Start the service: `docker compose up -d`.
4.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` to confirm it's working.
5.  **Live Update:** While the container is running, **edit the `index.html` file** on your host machine. Change the heading to `<h1>Live update with a Volume!</h1>`.
6.  Save the file and **refresh your browser**. The change appears instantly\!

## Exercise 4: Caching Rich Content with Varnish & NGINX ⚡

**Goal:** Build a two-tier web application with a Varnish cache serving a rich webpage from an NGINX backend.

1.  **Create the File Structure:**
      * Create a new folder (e.g., `ex4-varnish-cache`).
      * Inside, create two subfolders: `varnish` and `my-dynamic-website`.
2.  **Create the Web Content:**
      * Find a fun animated GIF online and save it inside `my-dynamic-website` as `animation.gif`.
      * Inside `my-dynamic-website`, create an `index.html` file to display the GIF:
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>Varnish Cache Test</title>
            <style> body { font-family: sans-serif; text-align: center; } </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>This page is being cached by Varnish!</h1>
            <img src="animation.gif" alt="Cached animation">
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
3.  **Create the Varnish Configuration:**
      * Inside the `varnish` folder, create a file named `default.vcl`. This tells Varnish where to find the NGINX server.
        ```vcl
        vcl 4.1;
        backend default {
            .host = "nginx";
            .port = "80";
        }
        ```
4.  **Create the Compose File:**
      * In the root of your `ex4-varnish-cache` folder, create the `compose.yml`:
        ```yaml
        services:
          cache:
            image: varnish:stable
            volumes:
              - ./varnish:/etc/varnish
            ports:
              - "8080:80"
            depends_on:
              - nginx

          nginx:
            image: nginx:alpine
            volumes:
              - ./my-dynamic-website:/usr/share/nginx/html
        ```
5.  **Run and Verify:**
      * Start the services: `docker compose up -d`.
      * Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see your webpage with the GIF. The key here is that **Varnish** served you the page, not NGINX directly.
      * **See the cache in action:** Check the NGINX logs for the first request.
        ```bash
        $ docker compose logs nginx
        ```
      * Now, refresh your browser page several times. Check the `nginx` logs again. You should see **no new log entries**, because Varnish is serving the content from its cache without contacting the NGINX backend.

## Exercise 5: Deploying a Real-World Application

**Goal:** Learn to read official documentation and deploy a complex, self-hosted service of your choice.

1.  **Choose a Service:** Go to [LinuxServer.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) and browse their list of popular images. Choose one that interests you, for example:

      * **Jellyfin:** A media server for your movies and music.
      * **Nextcloud:** A personal cloud for files, contacts, and calendars.
      * **Home Assistant:** An open-source home automation platform.

2.  **Read the Documentation:** On the page for your chosen image, find the "Docker Compose" section. Read it carefully, paying close attention to the required **volumes** and **environment variables**.

      * **Volumes (`- ./config:/config`):** This is where the application's configuration will be stored on your host.
      * **Environment Variables (`PUID`, `PGID`, `TZ`):** These are critical. `TZ` sets your timezone (e.g., `Europe/Lisbon`). `PUID` and `PGID` ensure that files created by the container have the correct ownership. On Linux/macOS, find your ID by running the `id` command in your terminal. A common value is `1000`.

3.  **Create Your `compose.yml`:** Based on the documentation, create the file. Here is an example for **Jellyfin**:

    ```yaml
    services:
      jellyfin:
        image: lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest
        container_name: jellyfin
        environment:
          - PUID=1000
          - PGID=1000
          - TZ=Europe/Lisbon
        volumes:
          - ./config:/config
          - ./tvshows:/data/tvshows
          - ./movies:/data/movies
        ports:
          - "8096:8096"
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```

4.  **Prepare and Deploy:**

      * Create the local folders you defined in your volumes (e.g., `mkdir config tvshows movies`).
      * Run the application: `docker compose up -d`.

5.  **Explore:** Check the documentation for the default port number. For Jellyfin, it's `8096`. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8096` and follow the setup wizard for your new service\!
