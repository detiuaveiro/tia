# Projects

Form groups of two or three students (exceptionally, projects can be done individually) and select **one** of the following projects. All projects will be hosted on **GitHub**, using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/14801727-iei). Check [here](#github-classroom-access) for details.

The repository must contain all relevant scripts, configuration files, and a `README.md` with instructions on how to deploy the project.
It should also contain a project report in `PDF` format.

This is a three-week project (deadline 22/12/2025). You have until the end of this week to notify your professor (via e-mail) of your group members and chosen topic (the list of topics can be found [here](#topics)).

Do not forget to contact your professor with any questions.
Further instructions may be added.

## Topics

### 1. The "Markdown to PDF" Factory

* **Description:** Create a Dockerized service that converts Markdown files into professional PDFs. You must create a `Dockerfile` that installs **Pandoc** and a minimal LaTeX distribution (e.g., `texlive-xetex`). The container should run a **Bash script** that monitors a specific input **volume**. When a `.md` file is detected in that volume, the script must automatically convert it to `.pdf` and place the result in an output folder.
* **Core Topics:** Bash Scripting (loops, file monitoring), Docker Volumes, Document Compilation (Markdown & LaTeX).

### 2. Network Latency Visualizer

* **Description:** Develop a tool to analyze network stability using a containerized pipeline.
    1. Create a **Bash script** that "pings" a target (e.g., `google.com` or `ua.pt`) periodically and logs the timestamp and latency (ms) to a **CSV** file.
    2. Create a **Python script** that reads this CSV using **Pandas** or **Polars** and generates a line chart showing latency over time using **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn**.
    3. The entire process must run inside a container, saving the final plot to a volume.
* **Core Topics:** Networking (ICMP/Ping), Data Manipulation (CSV), Data Visualization, Docker.

### 3. Geo-Data Dashboard (Traffic or Weather)

* **Description:** Build a web dashboard that visualizes geographical data. You must create a **Python** script that uses an API to get Weather or traffic data or (using **Pandas** or **Polars**) that processes a dataset (e.g., a CSV of weather stations or traffic incidents with Lat/Lon coordinates) and exports it to JSON. Then, deploy a **Web Server** container (Nginx or Apache) hosting an HTML page. This page must use the **Leaflet** JavaScript library to read that JSON data and display markers on an interactive map.
* **Core Topics:** Web Programming (HTML/JS/Leaflet), Data Formatting (CSV to JSON), Docker, Web Servers.

### 4. The Universal CSV Plotter

* **Description:** Create a generic data visualization tool encapsulated in a Docker container. The container should run a **Python** script that accepts a CSV file (via webpage) and generates a plot based on arguments or a simple config file. For example, the script should be able to read `data.csv`, and using **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn**, generate a bar chart or scatter plot for two specific columns (e.g., "Date" and "Value"). The output image must be sent back into the page and allows download.
* **Core Topics:** Python Data Analysis (Pandas/Polars), Visualization libraries, CLI arguments, Docker Volumes.

### 5. Interactive Portfolio

* **Description:** Build and deploy a personal portfolio website using a lightweight web server container (like Nginx). Unlike Project 1, you must write the code yourself. The site must include:
    1. **HTML/CSS:** A responsive layout (Flexbox/Grid) for your bio and skills.
    2. **JavaScript:** An interactive component, such as a "Contact Me" form that validates input (e.g., ensures email format is correct) before showing a success alert, or a theme toggler (Dark/Light mode).
* **Core Topics:** Web Programming (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript), Web Servers, Docker.

### 6. Server Resource Report

* **Description:** Simulate a system administrator task. Create a script that generates a "server log" CSV file (Columns: Timestamp, CPU_Usage, RAM_Usage). Then, use **Pandas** or **Polars** to analyze this log and generate a warning report: identify rows where usage exceeded 90%. Finally, use **Seaborn** or **Matplotlib** to generate a graph of the resource usage trends and save it to disk. The project report should be compiled from Markdown, embedding this generated graph.
* **Core Topics:** Data Analysis, System Concepts, Markdown integration, Python.

## Github Classroom Access

Here are detailed instructions to access GitHub Classroom.
Most students can skip several step, given that these were completed in project 01.

### 1. Join the Assignment and Form Your Team

1.  **Access the link:** Go to [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/G2JP9M2D)
2.  **Find your name:** Select your name from the student list.
    > **Can't find your name?** All names registered on PACO were added. If yours is missing, please contact **[Prof. Mário Antunes](mailto:mario.antunes@ua.pt)**.
3.  **Create a team (ONE member only):** Only **one** person from your group should create a team. Follow this exact naming structure (the nmec should be sorted): `[nmec1]_[nmec2]_[nmec3]_project02`
      * *(Example: `132745_133052_project02`)*
4.  **Join the team (All other members):** The remaining project members must find and join the team created in the previous step.

-----

## 2. Access the Organization and Repository

1.  **Accept the email invite:** After joining a team, all members will receive an email invitation to join the `detiuaveiro` GitHub organization.
2.  **You must accept this invitation** before you can continue.
3.  **Refresh the page:** Go back to the GitHub Classroom page and refresh it.
4.  **Verify access:** You should now see and have access to your team's working repository.

-----

## 3. Configure an SSH Key for Access

This will allow you to clone and push to the repository from your command line without entering your password every time.

1.  **Check for an existing SSH key:**
    Open your terminal and run this command:

    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

2.  **Generate a key (if needed):**

      * If you see a key (starting with `ssh-ed25519...`), copy the entire line and skip to step 3.
      * If you see an error like "No such file or directory," run the following command to create a new key:
        ```bash
        ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -N ''
        ```
      * After it's generated, run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` again to view your new key and copy it.

3.  **Add the key to your GitHub account:**

      * Go to your GitHub **Settings**.
      * On the left menu, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
      * Click the **New SSH key** button.
      * Give it a **Title** (e.g., "My UA Laptop").
      * Paste the key you copied into the **Key** field.
      * Make sure the "Key type" is set to **Authentication Key**.
      * Click **Add SSH key**.

4.  **Authorize the key for SSO:**

      * After adding the key, find it in your list on the same page.
      * Click **Configure SSO**.
      * Select the **detiuaveiro** organization, fill in your login details, and grant access.
