# Projects

**This project is strictly individual.** Select **one** of the following projects. All projects will be hosted on **GitHub**, using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/dAaBPriU). Check [here](#github-classroom-access) for details.

The repository must contain all relevant scripts, configuration files, and a `README.md` with instructions on how to deploy the project.
It should also contain a project report in `PDF` format.

This is the **final project**, designed to integrate the various skills acquired throughout the semester (Shell Scripting, Docker, Python, Data Analysis, and Web Technologies).

This is a three-week project (deadline January 14, 2025). You have until the end of this week to notify your professor (via e-mail) of your chosen topic (the list of topics can be found [here](#topics)).

Do not forget to contact your professor with any questions.
Further instructions may be added.

## Topics

### 1. The IoT Simulator & Dashboard

* **Description:** Simulate a complete IoT pipeline using three Docker containers orchestrated by Compose.
    1.  **Sensor Node (Python):** A script that generates synthetic "sensor data" (e.g., temperature, humidity, or energy usage) with random noise and sends it via HTTP POST every few seconds.
    2.  **Collector API (FastAPI):** Receives the data, validates it, and appends it to a persistent log file (CSV or SQLite) stored in a **volume**.
    3.  **Dashboard (Streamlit or Dash):** Reads the persistent data and displays a real-time auto-updating chart.
* **Core Topics:** Docker Compose, Python Scripting, APIs (FastAPI), Data Visualization, Volumes.

### 2. Automated System Monitor with Alerts

* **Description:** Create a robust system monitoring solution.
    1.  **Agent (Bash Script):** A script running on the host (or a privileged container) that checks system health (Disk usage `df`, Memory `free`, or Load Average `uptime`). It should run periodically (loop or cron).
    2.  **Logic:** If a threshold is breached (e.g., Disk > 90%), the script must trigger an alert.
    3.  **Alert Service (Python):** A Dockerized Python script that accepts the alert message as an argument or environment variable and "logs" it to a structured JSON file with a timestamp.
    4.  **Report:** Use **Pandas** to analyze the generated log file and print a summary of how many alerts occurred per day.
* **Core Topics:** Advanced Bash Scripting, System Commands, Python Data Processing, Error Handling.

### 3. The "Stock Market" Analyzer

* **Description:** Build a service that tracks and visualizes financial or crypto data.
    1.  **Fetcher (Python):** A script that fetches real data from a public API (e.g., CoinGecko or a stock API) for 3 different assets over a specific period.
    2.  **Storage:** Save this raw data into a structured CSV file.
    3.  **Web Server (Nginx + HTML/JS):** Serve a static webpage. Use **JavaScript (Fetch)** to load the CSV/JSON data and render a comparison chart using a library like **Chart.js** or **Leaflet** (if mapping locations).
    4.  **Analysis:** A separate Python script must calculate the "Volatility" (standard deviation) of the assets and output the riskiest asset to the console.
* **Core Topics:** External APIs, CSV handling, Web Server (Nginx), JavaScript/DOM, Statistical Analysis (Pandas).

### 4. The Secure Document Vault

* **Description:** Create a file storage system that demonstrates security and scripting.
    1.  **Uploader (Python/FastAPI):** An API that accepts file uploads. Before saving, it must hash the file (SHA256) to ensure integrity.
    2.  **Encryptor (Bash Script):** A script that watches the upload folder. When a new file arrives, it encrypts it using `gpg` or `openssl` with a predefined key/passphrase and deletes the original.
    3.  **Access:** A simplified HTML frontend that lists the available (encrypted) files.
    4.  The project report must explain the file permissions used (chmod/chown) to ensure only the script can read the raw files.
* **Core Topics:** Security concepts (Hashing/Encryption), Bash Automation, API File Handling, Linux Permissions.

### 5. The "Markdown Report" CI/CD Pipeline

* **Description:** Simulate a Continuous Integration pipeline for generating documentation.
    1.  **Environment:** A Docker container containing **Pandoc**, **LaTeX**, and **Python**.
    2.  **Trigger:** A **Bash script** monitors a folder for changes to a `data.csv` file.
    3.  **Action:** When the data changes:
        * Run a Python script to generate new plots (PNGs) from the CSV.
        * Update a Markdown file to include the new date and stats.
        * Run **Pandoc** to compile the Markdown + Plots into a final PDF report.
* **Core Topics:** Dockerfiles (Custom Images), Bash Monitoring, Document Compilation, Python Plotting (Matplotlib).

### 6. Network Reconnaissance & Visualization

* **Description:** A tool to scan a network and visualize connected devices.
    1.  **Scanner (Bash/Python):** A script that performs a ping sweep (or uses `nmap` if installed) on the local container subnet to discover active IP addresses.
    2.  **Logger:** Store the active IPs and their response times in a database or CSV.
    3.  **Visualizer (Python/Web):** A web service that displays the network topology (which IPs are up) and a histogram of response times.
    4.  **Deployment:** Must be deployable via a single `docker-compose up` command that creates a private network for testing the scanner.
* **Core Topics:** Networking (Subnets/IPs), Docker Networking, Scripting, Data Visualization.

## Github Classroom Access

Here are detailed instructions to access GitHub Classroom.
Most students can skip several steps, given that these were completed in previous projects.

### 1. Join the Assignment and Form Your Team

1.  **Access the link:** Go to [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/dAaBPriU)
2.  **Find your name:** Select your name from the student list.
    > **Can't find your name?** All names registered on PACO were added. If yours is missing, please contact **[Prof. Mário Antunes](mailto:mario.antunes@ua.pt)**.
3.  **Create a team: Follow this exact naming structure (the nmec should be sorted): `[nmec]_project03`
      * *(Example: `132745_project03`)*

-----

## 2. Access the Organization and Repository

1.  **Accept the email invite:** After joining a team, all members will receive an email invitation to join the `detiuaveiro` GitHub organization.
2.  **You must accept this invitation** before you can continue.
3.  **Refresh the page:** Go back to the GitHub Classroom page and refresh it.
4.  **Verify access:** You should now see and have access to your team's working repository.

-----

## 3. Configure an SSH Key for Access

This will allow you to clone and push to the repository from your command line without entering your password every time.

1.  **Check for an existing SSH key:**
    Open your terminal and run this command:

    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

2.  **Generate a key (if needed):**

      * If you see a key (starting with `ssh-ed25519...`), copy the entire line and skip to step 3.
      * If you see an error like "No such file or directory," run the following command to create a new key:
        ```bash
        ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -N ''
        ```
      * After it's generated, run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` again to view your new key and copy it.

3.  **Add the key to your GitHub account:**

      * Go to your GitHub **Settings**.
      * On the left menu, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
      * Click the **New SSH key** button.
      * Give it a **Title** (e.g., "My UA Laptop").
      * Paste the key you copied into the **Key** field.
      * Make sure the "Key type" is set to **Authentication Key**.
      * Click **Add SSH key**.

4.  **Authorize the key for SSO:**

      * After adding the key, find it in your list on the same page.
      * Click **Configure SSO**.
      * Select the **detiuaveiro** organization, fill in your login details, and grant access.
